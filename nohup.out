Did you ever hear the tragedy of Donald Trump The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Democrats would tell you. It’s a Republican legend. Donald Trump was a Dark President of the Republican Party, so tremendous and so wise he could use the executive branch to influence the taxpayers to create walls… He had such a knowledge of the conservative side that he could even keep the ones who supported him from fact-checking his statements. The right side of the political spectrum is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice shocked him for being gay. Ironic. He could save others from theocracy, but not himself.

the meme cannot be destroyed by any craft we here poses.  The meme was made in the fires of r/Prequelmemes, only there can it be unmade.

It must be taken deep into r/Prequelmemes and cast into the fiery chasm from whence it came.

2017/07/20 - 01:34:14 New comment by: ItkovianShieldAnvil
Furthermore, I don't understand why I am being downvoted so much? Do people think I am being slanderous? Sure Obi-Wan makes the comment I am not much of a one for politics, but the comment that the perfect woman doesn't discuss politics that the comic is implying is definitely not something Canadian. We don't mind expressing our political opinions. My best friend has completely opposing political ideals and we don't hold that against each other. So while the meme is humorous, it is, as I stated before based on my geographical limitations of knowledge, more of an American thing to think the perfect woman is less motivated to discuss political ideals.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Saruman the wise? I thought not, it's not a story Gandalf would tell you. Saruman was a wizard of the white council so powerful, and so wise, he could influence the istari magic to protect....life. He was so knowledgeable of the white magic, he could even protect those he cared about from the forces of darkness. The white wizard possessed many abilities some consider to be.....unnatural. He became so righteous, that the only thing he came to fear, was losing that righteousness, which eventually of course he did. He spoke to Sauron through the palantir, and Sauron corrupted him to evil. Ironic, he could save others from darkness, but not himself.

It's treason then.

In all seriousness, I think it's ok for Anakin seeing as he was a child of the force itself and thus would have the natural reflexes. He wouldn't have been able to beat a Sith like Rey was though.

Ehhh he wasn't trying though. Rey specifically tried to  use the Jedi mind trick. She doesn't even know she is force sensitive and even if she did she had no training whatsoever to know what to do and it would probably have ended pretty badly if it hadn't.

Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not. It's not the sort of story Coors would tell you. It's an Edmund's legend...the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise was a beer so rounded and balanced, it could influence the hops to create...spice.

I have a theory that she was a student of Luke's, but had her memory wiped. If this is true then she could have been acting on instinct without knowing it I guess? Also kylo was in her head, it's not too much of a stretch to say that he had made himself vulnerable during that time and she was given access to his mind through just trying to resist him. I know we meme the movie but I don't really think it's much of a plot hole if we haven't had the full story yet.

I'm supposing that scholars of the force and thousands of years of focus and imagination.

I mean look at cheese. Someone had to milk a cow first, someone had to take that milk and wait for it to sour first. Someone had to also figure out how to do it just right for it to be done enjoyably first. Probably a lot of accidental and procedural processes.

To see someone come out of nowhere and just make cheese without any training is just as silly as someone coming out of nowhere and knowing how to use the force with so much skill that they beat someone who has been doing it naturally for years and doing it very well under training.

Like I said, these were asserted unto me by Americans. The one got very irate with me about it. And the quote mentioned in no way mentions a woman. Obi-Wan was celibate. I could go on defending myself, but all I have left to say is fuck you all. It was an offhanded comment based on what persons of a different culture insisted was the case. I am sorry that people took offence to it, lighten the fuck up. To those blatantly mocking me and calling my intelligence into question, fuck you. So what if my opinions are a little varied from yours? That is life, and how you are responding to my postulations is comparable to a jihadist response to the American way of life. The only difference is they have the actual fuckin balls to get up in your face about it when they say they have a problem with how you think rather than sitting behind a screen safely sending anonymous insults at an unknown. Fuck the unknown, I do not know him and won't ever know him, I can say what I want about that person, I want them to be unhappy because hey, lookout for number one.

Watto knew about mind tricks. Rey might have heard of it before too. Maybe she was using it unknowingly, but when she figured out that the force was with her, she realized how it's done. 

Mind tricks aren't a bunch of procedural steps, you just wave your hand, make suggestions, and have the right state of mind. She didn't know about the hand wavy thing, maybe it would work even better if she did.

You're getting angry and political in a subreddit entirely dedicated to memes about a series of films that are generally accepted as 'not good' (as much as this subreddit would probably kill me for suggesting that).


There's a time and place for nuance political discussion and right now in /r/prequelmemes is the furthest place from it. 

There's a reason for your downvotes and it's because you've come across as immediately defensive and spiteful, whilst trying to sound eloquent which just adds an additional disconnect to the meme-quoting bullshit that's usually here. 

It's just awkward and irrelevant, especially since you came into the conversation wrong off the bat. This has nothing to do with 'Americans believing women shouldn't discuss politics' and more that Obi-Wan has expressed his displeasure at them before. Shared beliefs and attitudes are attractive qualities in a partner. Obi-Wan doesn't like to discuss politics (not 'brave enough') and along comes a woman who feels the same way. It was an obvious joke that you've somehow gotten really offended by.

If anything, Americans love discussing their politics so much on Reddit that a lot of people have purposefully flocked to places like /r/prequelmemes where people can just joke around and not care about that shit. I don't come into /r/jokes and start a discussion on the finer point of the Israel/Palestine conflict.

Tl;dr time and place, chill your beans.

Well, seeing as it's a fictional near magic ability, and I'm not sure even the most intense Star Wars Scholar knows *exactly* how it works. I'm just answering that it doesn't appear to be as simple as a hand wave and hearing about an ability.

Let's say she heard about Jedi mind tricks in the same way we both just heard about how cheese was made. Doesn't make either of us qualified cheese makers. But like I said if there's entire books and movies full of information that suggest that using the force is not an "easy" skill then it's hard to believe someone can just up and use it. 

Also Watto was around during the Jedi Council days so there wasn't any Empire crackdown on Jedi information/propaganda about Jedi/Force knowledge. Even after the fall of the empire a orphaned scrapper might have heard about Jedi/force mind tricks, doesn't make her an expert in using it anymore than you or I.

>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Donald Trump The ~~Wise~~ Plus-Size? I thought not. It’s not a story ~~the Democrats~~ Fox news would tell you. It’s a Republican legend. Donald Trump was a Dark President of the Republican Party, so tremendous and so ~~wise~~ bigly he could use the ~~executive branch~~ Russian government to influence the ~~taxpayers~~ voters to ~~create walls~~ win bigly… He had such a knowledge of the ~~conservative~~ colluding side that he could even keep the ones who supported him from fact-checking his statements. The right side of the political spectrum is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. (No unnatural. No unnatural. You're unnatural.) He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. ~~Unfortunately~~ Unsurprisingly, he taught his ~~apprentice~~ son everything he knew, then his ~~apprentice~~ son ~~shocked him for being gay~~ released emails suggesting collusion. Ironic. He could save others ~~from theocracy~~ from emails, but not himself.

I don't see her being a Skywalker, but really do think she's just his trainee. She thinks her family left her, cause that's basically what would make most sense to her as a child, but it doesn't mean it has to be actual family. I totally agree that making her another goddamned Skywalker would be a total cop out, but I don't think she has to have any blood ties to anyone. With that said, they could definitely go that route, but I have faith in Rian Johnson to tell the story excellently no matter what.

The straight hilt aka "standard light saber" was design as a slashing weapon as when you hold, it makes a degree to your arm, thus allow you to perform slashing move. 

Curved hilt aka "Dooku's saber" instead pointing the blade along with your arm, thus it's easier to perform stabbing move.

Yeah, I think Rey did do a bit more than she should have while she was still learning the force, but some people exaggerate how ridiculous it was she beat Kylo Ren. He was in pain and was hardly a full-fledged Sith --- which they made a point of, him beating his side to try and null the pain, or get the blood out, or what have you. 

See, I feel Rey did go a bit far, but there was --- usually --- setup with what happened. For example: The First Order is an off-shoot of the Empire, Rey has experience exploring a Star Destroyer for parts, she has some sense of how to get around Starkiller Base.

1-Watto knew about mind tricks because he was living at a time when Jedi were numerous and well known. By the time of A New Hope, the Jedi were all but extinct and Luke had never heard of them.

2-Rey didn't know the jedi were real until that same afternoon. "The Jedi were real?" she asks Han. Thus anything she had heard up until that point would have likely been mixed in with legends and exaggerations with no way of telling what was true and what wasn't. For all she knew, a jedi could transform into the flying spaghetti monster.

3-We don't see direct evidence in the movie that Rey heard about it before or that she had been using it unknowingly. If it is not shown or mentioned in the movie, it does not exist. A simple flashback or previous attempt early on would have been enough to show that she had. Instead, she just pulls Obi-Wan Kenobi (aka Jedi Master) level mind tricks on not one but two people on day 1, something Luke only achieved on the third movie several years later and only after actively training under both Obi-Wan and Yoda. 

4-If picking it up is that easy, by day 2 she should have been levitating x-wings.

I agree with you completely. I think she's definitely a Skywalker or more likely a Kenobi. Obi-Wan had a British accent and so does she and if she was a Skywalker that might be too blatant even for Disney. The lightsaber she's using is probably the one Obi-Wan lost on the Death Star in A New Hope (as opposed to Luke's lightsaber at the bottom of Cloud City, which was my initial thought).

 She's Obi-Wan's granddaughter or grandniece or something, Luke takes her under his wing for training but when shit hits the fan with Kylo, he hides her and Force wipes her memory. 

2017/07/20 - 10:45:42 New comment by: Afrobean
> learning jedi mind tricks though takes alot of training however

Can you cite precedence for this claim? If Luke can use Force telekinesis in Empire without any training in that skill, why be so sure that the Jedi mind trick could never ever be performed by a first-time beginner too?

Luke also used Force telekinesis in Empire without formal training in that skill, and although it's not canon now, I believe young Galen Marek uses the same Force telekinesis to pull Darth Vader's lightsaber out of his hand. Force adept folks use the Force without training all the time.

Or if the ancient sith race actually created the energy AND information network that they call the Force.

It may well be their way of trying to pass on their cultural values and memory and preventing it from becoming extinct. After all, if we made an AI in charge of an extradimensional energy field, we'd want it to preserve the things we consider important and the human outlook on things, wouldn't we?

I thought not. It’s not a story the Original posters would tell you. It’s a Repost legend. Darth Repost was a Dark Lord of Reddit, so powerful and so wise he could use the Posts to influence the upvotes to to reach the frontpage… He had such a knowledge of the repost side that he could even keep the memes he cared about from dying. The repost side of the Posts is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his posts, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him with reposts. Ironic. He could save memes from death, but not himself.

One would assume Jabba the Hutt is fairly famous, so you'd think he'd know better than to use such an obvious name as an alias - then again, Hondo was a (moderately) famous pirate and either didn't realise or just went along with it (unless I'm mistaken and Ezra pretended to be Lando in that episode).

I edited my last comment  for better context. The Sith race didn't create the dark side nor did the first fallen Jedi that first arrived on Koriban and conquered it. They could use essence transfer of something like that to jump bodies or clones... The most common technique was to use Sith alchemy to create a holocron to record your knowledge to.

But they both still failed their first battle with dark side user. Rey heard about force like few hours ago, and SUDDENLY she can:
1. Defend from mind reading.
2. Mind read another force user.
3. Mind control.
4. Force Pull.
5. Use lightsaber and even defeat neo sith with it.

Dooku was mainly used Form 2, which is an aggressive-focus form . It was actually widely used back in the Old Republic / Sith Empire era when Jedi's Order was in constant conflict with the Sith. Later on when Darth Bane brought the Sith into shadow and reformed into Rule of 2, the Order believed that Jedi now stands as the guardian of peace, not warrior. As so, the aggressive Form 2 was slowly fading in favor of other defensive forms.

Anakin trained for 10 years with Obi-Wan, he was a chosen one with highest force potential, still lost his first battle with sith lord and got his hand cut off.
Luke trained for 3 days with grandmaster of jedi order, he was already using force before that, still lost his first battle with sith lord and got his hand cut off.
Rey got absolutely no training, barely heard about Force, never seen a lightsaber - can use dozens of different force abilities and defeated neo sith lord, that destroyed new jedi order, without a single scratch.

I mean, the form that Obi-Wan uses during the clone era is basically the pinnacle of defensive style Lightsaber Combat. He is just performing defensive moves and trying to wear down his opponent into making a mistake, which eventually of course they do.

Because he basically taught her how in that moment. Kid's a natural.

>Mind control.

>Force Pull

So what? Shit's easy if you're force sensitive.

>Use lightsaber

Finn, a stormtrooper, also had no issues using a lightsaber.

>Even defeat neo sith with it.

After Chewy **blew up his rib cage.**

I really don't wanna go here, but most TFA complaints are rooted in sexism tbh. If Finn beat Kylo, he would have gotten less shit from fans than Rey did. We would hear about how he's a trained soldier and that Kylo wasn't properly trained and severely injured, so it makes sense.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?

2017/07/20 - 14:37:20 New comment by: moosic1
I did a rewatch of TFA a few weeks ago; here are a few of the notes that I made:
> 
Rey is able to resist and retaliate against Kylo's mind probe about 2 minutes after he started the interrogation session; she was able to do this while under a lot of stress and without any teacher guiding her through it.
>     
Rey is able to do a successful Jedi Mind Trick 30 seconds after her first attempt; she is able to do this while under a lot of stress and without any teacher guiding her through it.
> 
Rey is able to successfully summon Luke's lightsaber, and in doing so also counteract Kylo Ren's force summon, 11 seconds after she sees Kylo Ren start to pull; she was able to do this while coming out of unconsciousness and without any teacher guiding her through it.
> 
Rey is surprised when Kylo Ren says "I can show you the ways of the Force," as though there was some other magic power that she was using to do all this shit. 

The key difference between Rey and Anakin is that Anakin was not doing anything that was completely unnatural. His force powers only manifested as an extension of his normal human reaction time.

The key difference between Rey and Luke is that Luke did have some training, albeit a very short session. However, that training does set him on the right path; he has enough knowledge that he could teach himself/experiment with his powers. For a real-life example, imagine handing a guitar to someone who knows all the major scales vs. handing a guitar to someone with no musical knowledge.

(I do think it's bullshit that Luke physically guided it; I think it would make more sense if they attributed it to heightened senses, but what can you do)

It’s a Libertarian legend. Ron Swanson was a Dark Lord of Libertarianism, so powerful and so wise he could use woodworking to influence the local governments to shut down… He had such a knowledge of Swanson Pyramid of Greatness that he could even keep the ones he cared about from eating vegetables. The dark side of woodworking is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid was his gold being found by his ex-wives, which eventually, of course, it was. Unfortunately, he ate too much breakfast food, and Tammy One killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from blondes and vegans, but not himself.

I don't know, it's one thing to subconciously use the force to increase your reflexes and overall mundane abilities, but another to pretty much cast several quite specific force spells without having studied the force, or how exactly to use it for these party tricks for that matter. 

Like, imagine if Harry Potter would randomly pull well-executed high-level wizardry out of his ass and fuck Voldemordt in a fair duel as early as Philosopher's Stone, it breaks your suspension of disbelief because the series depicts magic as this quite difficult and time-consuming skill to learn that is really extremely limited until you learn how to channel your wizard powers into something useful with proper application(like igniting something, making a light or making an object spite gravity). At the same time you could still give a wizard without training some strong but reasonable everyday skills that are a result of or at least related to an innate magical prowess. Maybe they're really good at the kind of logical thinking you'd require to properly execute a spell, or similar.

If someone with any force skill whatsoever would've maybe described roughly how to execute a force mind control trick and the other tricks and Rey just happens to nail the execution by sheer luck, then sure, at least the knowledge wouldn't come from nowhere. As it was handled, it was quite unbelievable, pretty much a Deus Ex Machina, and made Rey look a bit like a Mary Sue just magically pulling that knowledge out of her ass and applying it perfectly the second time around.

Palpatine was lying. He's a politician, and not to be trusted.

Plagueis could do all sorts of stuff like that at the peak of his power, but Anakin was not his doing. He was surprised to learn of it, immediately deduced it was the Force's answer to their antics, and even tried to meet young Anakin when he was on Coruscant to investigate, he just didn't stop by at a good time.

Finn was a weird character in general. His character motivations were warped and never seemed to change over time.

Oh my God, my friend died, war is Hell.

Must help his killer escape because it's the right thing to do.

Oh, wait, no, I want to escape the war. Not helping the Resistance.

From there it starts to improve, since his reasons are little more realistic and believable, but it took a lot longer than expected and even then he had some bad moments in my opinion. Love the actor though, seems like he genuinely likes Star Wars or at least enough to keep at it.

I like the part where your first 4 points pretty blatantly highlight the badly written asspulling discussed("she's just *really*, **really** strong with the force", "she just made that shit up on the fly because she's *that* good"), give a perfectly sound argument for why Finn would have a better chance than Rey in a proper fight and then use these points to attribute the criticism to sexism anyway.

Rey can be the fucking deity of force shenanigans for all I care, and I still wouldn't buy her pretty much reinventing several force powers from scratch in a span of minutes. Spanking Kylo I can see happening, because he already received a thrashing by the time they fought and he seems like a whiny bitch in training that's easily thrown off and rattled anyway. She has no knowledge of any of the fancy tricks like Mind Control, Mind Reading(and/or resistance thereof) and lightsaber calling though, and it seems extremely jarring that she pulls these things flawlessly the first few tries without any instructions whatsoever.

2017/07/20 - 15:36:42 New comment by: daniel_22s
"I really don't wanna go here, but most TFA complaints are rooted in sexism tbh. If Finn beat Kylo, he would have gotten less shit from fans than Rey did. We would hear about how he's a trained soldier and that Kylo wasn't properly trained and severely injured, so it makes sense."
Nobody complains that Padme/Leia/Jyn is good with the blaster, so your argument is invalid. The fact itself, that fucking STORMTROOPER could fight with dark-side user and even could wound him is already pissing me off, if that nigga had beaten Kylo, I would just break my screen. 
"Maybe she's really fucking strong with the force."
Im sorry, we had a boat load of people, that are powerful with the force. Guess what - they still needed training. And if she is THAT much stronger than both Luke and Anakin, then its just another + to her being Mary Sue.
"Because he basically taught her how in that moment. Kid's a natural."
Thats a weird argument, well, okay. But it doesnt work with mind control. Nobody showed her that, Kylo didnt use it on her, we dont even know if he can do that shit.
"So what? Shit's easy if you're force sensitive." Luke barely did it by himself, and Rey somehow outmatched Kylo's force pull.
"Finn, a stormtrooper, also had no issues using a lightsaber."
He just used that as a stick. And he lost both times with it. 
"After Chewy blew up his rib cage."
That argument is not working, because if it was THAT bad, he wouldnt go after Rey and Finn. He was running around, swinging, jumping, he even beat his wound for more pain. For a dark side user thats not a problem. I know many siths from both canon and EU, that were kicking ass without half of a body.
And no, I did not hear that tragedy. Is it something the jedi would not tell me?

I'm betting that she has had previous training, probably with Luke, before the Knights of Ren destroyed Lukes Academy. So she was probably somehow tapping into powers she learned as a child that maybe laid dormant for years of being alone on Jakku. There's so much that hasn't been explained. Wait for the trilogy to finish before jumping to conclusions.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Sauron "the eye"? I thought not. It's not a story the Elves would tell you. It's an Orc legend. Sauron was a Dark Lord of Morgoth, so powerful and so wise he could influence Celebrimbor to create rings... He had such a knowledge of the process that he could even make One Ring to Rule Them All. The rings are a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he tried to take over the world, then the ring was cut from his hand. It's ironic he could give others rings of power, but not himself.

> Like I said, these were asserted unto me by Americans.

And I know Americans that both confirm and differ (often to extreme degrees) from that. Your evidence comes from to small a sample group to be relative on the wider population.

>And the quote mentioned in no way mentions a woman. Obi-Wan was celibate.

What I meant went right over your head. The quote "I'm not brave enough for politics" is often used to say that Obi-Wan does not like politics and avoids them, at least in the same way the memes say that that Anakin has outright PTSD from sand. This memes shows Jyn having the same political beliefs as himself (basically zero) which logically appeals to him.

>Obi-Wan was celibate. 

[First, that is debatable.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Satine_Kryze) Second memes like this often have characters act different from their normal behavior.

>That is life, and how you are responding to my postulations is comparable to a jihadist response to the American way of life.

What a stupid comparison. No one is responding negatively to your way of life or your views on how active people should be in politics. They are only disagreeing about your beliefs on how much Americans care about politics (beliefs that are based on a very small sample size that, as a member of that same nation I can say is not at all reflect) and your blatantly inaccurate beliefs about the purpose of this meme.

>I want them to be unhappy because hey, lookout for number one. Get fucked, the lot of you poseurs

First, putting yourself above others doesn't mean wanting others to suffer. Second just what a selfish attitude. When it comes to the well being of millions of people and all you care about is yourself you are not the kind of person I want involved in politics. And why do you care so much about people you do not know if all you care is about yourself?

Smeagol was a fisherman of the Hobbits, so skillful and keen-eyed he could swim in the river to find the One Ring... He had such a connection to the ring that he could even turn invisible. The One Ring to Rule Them All is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his ring, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he dropped it, then Bilbo Baggins found it under the mountains. It's ironic he could save others from Mount Doom, but not himself.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Hillary Clinton? I thought not. It's not a story the liberal media would tell you. It's a Republican legend. Hillary Clinton was a politician, so powerful and so wise she could use collusion to influence the Democratic Party to rig the primaries... She had such a knowledge of politics that she could secretly help Donald Trump win the Republican primary. Marrying Bill Clinton is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. She became so powerful... the only thing she was afraid of was losing an election, which eventually, of course, she did. Unfortunately, she taught Donald Trump about the electoral college, then his supporters helped him win without a majority. It's ironic she could rig elections against Bernie, but not for herself.

Every word in internet loses its meaning after a while.

Thicc used to mean very curvy women (Or bigg butts) and now its used with everything.

Weeaboo used to mean people that were over obsessed with Japanese culture and tried to act like Japanese but came down as offensive. Now the word is directed against everyone that watches Anime.

Meme used to mean anything that spreads from human to human trough culture (of any kind, like your small group of friends have their own culture), but now it mostly means internet memes (Which still, ironically spread from human to human like culture.)

I think that's because it would come so out of the blue, while in the Prequels it was right there in the first film. Also, I don't think the podrace scène has much Force in it, I'd rather criticise it for Anakin having never finished a race before. Then suddenly he wins because the Force wants it or something, not because he actually uses it.

Saturated fats: form mainly Low Density Lipoproteins when digested, and can cause atheroma formations in some arterial inner walls and cause all kinds of cardiac problems. In short, sat fats bad.






























Unsaturated fats: form mainly high density lipoproteins when digested, which actually knock LDLs off arterial walls, and keeps blood vessels open. Unsat fats good.

I think it was when she was very young. It happened in a flashback, she was taken from her home world very young. And the people she stayed with in a village were attacked by pirates, a Jedi was there fighting against the pirates, and was about to be killed by a pirate sneaking up on him. She force pushed the pirate away saving his life. Then the Jedi to her as his padawan.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Smeagol "the Gollum"? I thought not. It's not a story the goblins would tell you. It's a Hobbit legend. Smeagol was a fisherman of the Hobbits, so skillful and keen-eyed he could swim in the river to find the One Ring... He had such a connection to the ring that he could even turn invisible. The One Ring to Rule Them All is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his ring, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he dropped it, then Bilbo Baggins found it under the mountains. It's ironic he could save others from Mount Doom, but not himself.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Sauron "the eye"? I thought not. It's not a story the Elves would tell you. It's an Orc legend. Sauron was a Dark Lord of Morgoth, so powerful and so wise he could influence Celebrimbor to create rings... He had such a knowledge of the process that he could even make One Ring to Rule Them All. The rings are a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he tried to take over the world, then the ring was cut from his hand. It's ironic he could give others rings of power, but not himself.

C is typically use in the European/Asian countries as it is derived from the calculus idea of m = derivative at said point and c is the additional or subtractive amount to make the equation right. So, like so:

f(x) = f'(x)x +c

In the USA and more western countries, Calculus is taught later due to a higher need for Engineers and Technical workers who require less advanced Calculus/Mathematics, and more advanced knowledge of Euclidean Geometry and Algebra.

Since Obi-Wan encourages him to use the Force instead of the meter, I always interpreted it this way. I don't know if that's official, I don't really keepup with Star Wars books, comics or the canon. I just watch and enjoy the movies.

Why are you so angry? You made a generalization and people disagreed with you. That doesn't mean you need to wish death upon them or compare them to jihadists or whatever. You need to settle down and realize that people are going to disagree with you, and they're going to joke around about it especially on a subreddit dedicated to jokes. Idk man but it seems like you have some issues to work through. I'm not saying that as an insult or anything, but how you're acting isn't a normal or healthy reaction people joking around in a thread. You made a generalization based on a select few interactions you had and you were wrong. Accept that, forget about everyone that insulted you, and move on. All the best.

I was in 6th grade when the revenge of the Sith came out. My science teacher pulled myself and 2 other students out of class one day during a video to participate in a star wars trivia competition. 

The questions were extremely hard for a 6th grader  (specific characters names, kessel run stats, ect) but all of us received a rubber revenge of the Sith livestrong type band that she brought back from a star wars convention. 

If you're reading this Mrs. Johnson you're the reason I'm going to school to teach science!!!!

duneguy, what is so "techical" about sequels? New actors cant act, stupid american humor, lines, that make me cringe 10x more than "I dont like sand", action scenes arent interesting at all (they fucked up even lightsaber duel and trench run, which was impossible to do), Abrams was proud how he used practical effects.... for 3 scenes, and the rest was still CGI. Take out nostalgia effect, and this movie is impossible to rewatch.

I think what Lucas portrayed in the movies is really basic at it's core and that's what makes them good films. There is hate and there is love within every person, like Luke. And we ultimately have the capability to bring out either of those feelings in the end. Pretty simple. Sith is literally everything bad about you, by definition. Jedi is everything good about you. Just terminology but yeah there's overlap in the prequels. The Emperor was literally modeled after Hitler. There's not supposed to be a grey scale in the OT. In the prequels it's laid out pretty well. "There are heroes on both sides" and "from my point of view the Jedi are evil". The audience has the choice to decide which side they like but look at the damage done by one and the healing done by the other. Light side and dark side are just two sides to every mind. Making good choices brings you closer to the light side, bad choices closer to the darkness. No one said one is better than the other but look at the characters. Look at the pain and suffering that occurs with the dark side, you can sell your soul to Space Hitler based on a promise and he will literally break the promise three minutes later "lol jk, we can't save your wife!!". Look at the light side, harder to survive, harder to progress, harder to grow, but eventually coming out on top. I never really saw star wars as having some deep political underlying themes or social construct being weaved into the story. It's just good vs evil. Simple, yeah?

Not to mention, she used a mind trick in an individual already brainwashed from birth (not exactly a strong feat), and she had kylo just try to use the force on her mind in a far more brutal way, which prompted her connection to the force to "activate" in her defense, so to speak. That much was pretty much a crash course and confirmation that the force does exist, and she can use it - all she had to do was test the theory and try to mimic what she literally just experienced through.

Dooku uses a curved hilt because he is a practitioner of the lightsaber combat Form II, aka Makashi. This form was developed in an age when lightsaber vs lightsaber combat was very common, so it focuses on elegance and dueling.

The gift I sent out should be arriving to its recipient tomorrow actually. She is not particularly active on Reddit, so I think it is unlikely to be posted here. My gift was shipped to me from overseas, so it should still be a few days I think. I was lucky to have been matched with a user called /u/ChinapplePunk as my gift giver. He is a moderator of /r/PrequelMemes's arch rival sub /r/SaladMemes. Our friendship is proof that polar opposites can find middle ground on the high ground. 

In all seriousness though. Great guy, very glad to have participated, and very proud that the admins reached out to the mods here to make this happen.

It still doesn't really work in my opinion. Why would she be dumped there by anyone that really cared about her. If it was Kylo, saving her (we see him kill someone that looks an awful lot like a Knight of Ren right in front of Rey in her vision) because he couldn't bring himself to kill her and maybe being close to her, but not kind enough to leave her somewhere safe since she would be more easily found by Snoke as proof that he's weak. 

Also, are you forgetting that Anakin was too old at 10?

Because her parent(s) died dude. Maz literally says so in the movie. Probably hunted down by Kylo Ren when he found out they were Obi Wan's descendant. Also you hear Obi Wan's voice in Rey's force vision call her name. Yeah there's other voices too, but they only repeat previous lines of dialogue 

Kylo, according to the lore, was born 1 year after Battle of Endor (5 ABY). Lor San Tekka, who you see die in the beginning of TFA, dies in 34 ABY. 34 - 5 is.... 29. Kylo Ren is 29 in TFA. Now buckle up kiddo, because here's the important part. Rey, ACCORDING TO THE LORE, was born in 15 ABY. So if she's abandoned on Jakku at 5(I looked up the flashback again, she's way younger than 7), that means Kylo was 15 at the time. 

We don't know what year the Knights of Ren formed, but the flashback we get with them slaughtering (or recruiting) Luke's padawans show teens or adults. If that's the case, it means she was left on Jakku before Ben even became Kylo.

From a marketing standpoint, this is the best way to go about making more Star Wars for consumers to enjoy. Hopefully all of the hype about different/darker/twist/moving forward-talk is going hold up. Just seeing all the new weapon styles,settings, and characters so far has given me a lot of hope for something that is coming soon. Like 5 months soon.

Because there are vastly differences between fiction fencing and real life fencing. In SW, you can almost compensate weakness by using the Force, while irl, you simply cant. The straigh hilt + guard provide you with both offensive techniques and defensive stands for it always make a degree to your arm, you can either swing to strike or to block / parry. 

There are curve hilt sword irl, however they werent made for stabbing but rather provides better one hand slashing strike, and usually with single edge blade rather than double edges, called *Scimitar*.

Obi-Wan should be the main character so that we see Anakin's life from the pov of his mentor and then from the pov of his son. That means that when Obi-Wan gives Luke Anakin's saber, he's metaphorically passing the torch.

Were you trying to reply to me? If so you replied to the main thread which only goes to the inbox of the OP, who never even spoke to you.

> I was not saying look out for number one in context to myself but in regards to your inane comments and others that have a total disregard for the opinions of others.

You really don't understand the intentions of the others in this thread. None of them have shown any selfishness in any way. They only meant to correct you do to you misunderstanding the message of a meme (which ultimately had no political message at all). Respecting the right of others to have opinions doesn't mean not vocally correcting them when they say something that is untrue. Otherwise people's poor preconceptions will never be challenged and people will just remain ignorant. If you can't stand people disagreeing with you on such minor issues without this degree of immaturity then you have a lot of growing up to do.

>You worship your own self importance and declare jihad on anyone whom you deem to be too different from yourself. Im not wandering lost and despondent wayward in my opinions and my similes are accurate in this situation you self righteous arrogant prick.

Since when did I or anyone else in this thread show any degree of self importance? And your Jihad comparison makes no sense. There is a world of difference between trying to correct someone when he misinterprets the message of some random Internet meme and (due to small sample sizes and what you [admitted was limited knowaglde](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/6o87vh/oh_no_im_not_brave_enough_for_dating/dkgeni4/)) has an blatantly inaccurate view about how vocal one nation is about politics and disagreeing with someone's lifestyle so much that you want to kill them. And for all you talk about respecting other people's opinions, when they simply vocally disagree with you on minor matters, [you wish for their deaths](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/6o87vh/oh_no_im_not_brave_enough_for_dating/dkgr0zt/), a reaction that is far closer to those of that radical Muslims have to Westerns for disagreeing with the their lifestyles and religion.

While I understand the feeling is not mutual, I still wish you the best.

This meme consists of a still from Drake's music video "Hotline Bling" with SLT (Sith Lord in Training) Darth Maul's head crudely photoshopped over it. Darth Maul has a double sided lightsaber hence why he is repulsed by the normal van but he is exceptionally giddy at the appearance of a doubled sided van.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Engine 49? I thought not. It's not a story the fire marshal would tell you. Engine 49 was a dark lord of the fire trucks, so powerful and so wise it could use highly pressurized water to put out fires. It had such a knowledge of safety and code it could even keep the kittens you cared about, from trees. The dark side of a fire truck is a pathway many consider to be unnatural. Eventually, the only thing he feared was losing his highly pressurized water cannon which of course he did so he taught his apprentice everything he knew and then his apprentice set him on fire in the fire station. Ironic. He could save others from flames but not himself.

Meh, idk how that sits with me. Most of the extended universe is no longer cannon I know, but everything outside of the movies paints a much more complex spectrum than everything being just good or evil. For example, the Republic literally just turns into the Empire but the senate still exists. Do all of the Republic senators suddenly become evil overnight? Especially since it's considered the standard for space operas i'm not sure if I can cut the universe as much slack as you can haha

**Circle 7 logo**

The Circle 7 logo is an often-used television station logo in the United States. Designed in the early 1960s for the American Broadcasting Company's five owned-and-operated stations (all of which broadcast on VHF channel 7), the logo, or a version of it, is currently being used not only by ABC stations and affiliates, but also by a number of television broadcasters around the world.

I never deemed your words unimportant. I the judge of one's writing only after reading it. Your initial posts were innocent misinterpretations that said little to no negative things about you. What came afterwards, however was not. You have shown yourself to be insecure, petty, and spiteful. If you would look above you will see that you are a hypocrite who is projecting. Your reaction to this has not been in any way that of a normal, mature adult. You need help.

http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Aayla_Secura/Legends#Personality_and_traits

> Secura had a brief romantic relationship with Kit Fisto, but she was dedicated to the Jedi Order and decided the Order was more important than her relationship with Fisto, though they would still nurse feelings for each other.

> She also had a close friendship with Commander Bly, but like most clones Bly obeyed Order 66, betrayed her trust, and killed her.

> Secura's attire was practical, albeit somewhat revealing, and allowed her to both move freely and show her Jedi affiliations. She also wore ornate jewelry on her navel. When she retired from her duties to sleep, she usually wore an ornate red and gold floral robe, although she tended to leave its folds fully open, exposing her body in the process.

You see, the Adolf Hitler was a member of the Nazi Party so powerful and charismatic, he could use speech to influence the populace to create... chaos. He became so powerful that eventually the only thing he feared was losing his power, which of course he did. Unfortunately for him, he was forced into his bunker, and he killed himself to avoid capture. Poetic. He would orchestrate others' deaths, but they only accelerated his.

There was two major "points"  the rule of two helped to accomplish:

1) It's much easier to hide from the Jedi when there are only two of you. 

2) Apprentice kills his Master after surpassing him,  therefore making sure that each next Sith Master stronger then the previous one. 

By the time Anakin says that line first reason is no longer relevant, as for the second,  well...  He might have greater potential than Sidious, but he's still hadn't learned a thing.

Have you ever heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

2017/07/21 - 10:57:15 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

It's a bit tricky but you can put it out. You have to open a bay door and pull an engine that isn't on fire out and start pumping water from there. If you're lucky the fire hasn't done too much damage and you can just have the damage cleaned up and possibly loose one truck. Worst case would be all trucks and the station are destroyed and millions in losses.

I thought this sub would last a month or two at most.  Sometimes it will go quiet for a week or two but then I see something like this and read the comments and all the glory of prequel memes comes back.

Simply because that would seem to belittle its majesty somehow. I think of it more as one of the fundamental truths of physics in that particular galaxy. There are other galaxies that seem to be devoid of the force. Like the one the Yuuzhan Vong come from, they were completely unaffected by the force.

One thing that would support your thought is the existence of the "Celestials". Could they have created midichlorians and the force or were they born from it?

I went back and watched it again last nite, after obsessively watching Rogue One the past few weeks. Ep 7 is better than the prequels, but kinda sucks in comparison to rogue one. I kept wanting it to be about poe, finn, and kylo ren. Everyone else in that movie is just boring af imo.

I believe I first heard of it in a video, that, although was about a Star Wars character, started to, unfortunately, criticize both the movies and fans (criticizing te fans is taking a bit too far). It was mentioned as a major influence of the rising popularity of the prequels.

Rogue One took a very different approach from the rest of the series (but closer to the TV shows). I can appreciate the prequels leaning more towards high fantasy, from elected queens to energy balls, but the more grounded style of Rogue One that wouldn't be out of place in a regular war movie was a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.

Dooku's qoute doesn't imply that the function is linear, he just references two points with a linear relationship. His pride-fall model could be multimodal or periodic, for instance, there's no reason why 1.5 times the fall couldn't be the result of 3 times the pride.

What would you say are the hardest parts of learning French besides pronunciation? I'm maybe intermediate in Spanish, and recently took up grinding French study on Lingvist, and I find absorbing vocabulary to be a breeze. Some grammatical points also carry over (like weather "doing cold", compare to *hace frio*).

I guess I'm curious what the major points are that defy expectations as a Romance language, so I can give them extra attention.

Before ROTS came out, Episode 1 was my favorite. Even though I already watched entire OT and I liked it, I didnt have any emotional connection with Luke, Leia, Han or Vader. But I really liked Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, never had any problems with young Anakin or Jar Jar, and of course, I was madly in love with Darth Maul. His battle with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan is still one of my favorites, and only Anakin vs Obi-Wan could surpass it.
P.S. That Maul fan-film was amazing.

Age 59...so yeah, I saw "Star Wars" in '77, the week it was released. Other than 2001 A Space Odyssey? Had never seen ANYTHING with such amazing special effects. 

Same for all other Star Wars-related releases. 

Yep, I like the entire franchise -- except for 1 and 2.  

(3 is my least favorite, but I don't hate it.) 

Saw 4, 5 and 6 so many times largely due to screenings with my sons, all three of whom were introduced at an early age (and they liked watching them over and over). 

So...a little perspective...

Hello there

2017/07/21 - 16:53:46 New comment by: humidifierman
My SO is French, and in my opinion other than the pronunciation, one thing that is hard is trying to "translate" French into English. I find it simpler sometimes to just try to understand phases in  French or have her explain a new word in French rather than translating to English. A lot of expressions can be metaphorical so translating then doesn't make any sense. I also don't ever expect to know what is masculine and feminine.

Obi-Wan knew he didn't have the high ground. Of course attacking would have been pointless. So he did a bombastic flip, gaining the high ground, before moving in for the kill. It was that crucial moment in which Maul didn't have the high ground that spelled his death.

At first thought, episode 3 Kenobi would be the clear victor in that he has infinitely more training including the clone wars and has had time to fully master the Jedi arts of "helloing there" and "landing happily" whereas episode 1 obi has only heard legend of tricks like "spinning" recently and thus would arguably be inferior! That said, episode 1 obi is not confined by the restraints of being "so civilised" as old bi wan is and thus could add a spontaneity that could surely kill not just the men, but the woman and the children too and thus defeating episode 3 obi in a fashion that would make any one uncontrollably say "yep". All this said, the real question we should be asking ourselves is - what about the droid attack on the Wookiees?

I mean depends on if he meant "least favorite Prequel" or "least favorite Star Wars movie". Cuz it's my least favorite prequel, but still, better than a New Hope.

Reaching the man cloth space is the emperor, he is so strong and big, he even can use the original dint to create life... He is very deep to black influence understanding. The black influence can the matter that many supermans, but other people thinks that these are what can't attains. He became more and more strong and big. Lost his power afterwards, afterwards he died. In fact, he teaches own the whole skills all to disciple, then his land killed him to let him going to bed. Satirizing the meaning is, he can let other people, but is incapable for dint to the oneself.

2017/07/21 - 20:12:38 New comment by: metal079
Obi-Wan doesn't need to be on the high ground, the high ground just needs to exist in the battle; Obi-Wan knows that when he has the low ground, he really has the high ground, from a certain point of view. Look at his battle record:

Maul: Has low ground, wins

Dooku: No high ground, loses

Greivous: Has low ground, wins

Vader: Has high ground, wins

Vader rematch: No high ground, loses

Obi-Wan with the high/low ground is canonically the most powerful Jedi. This is fact. Had Yoda not denied his request with typical Jedi arrogance, he could have beat Palpatine in the Senate building, which housed a variety of different altitudes; this so that the Chancellor could always have the moral high ground in Senate debates. But Obi-wan didn't fight Palpatine, and Yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the Sheev in a normal 1v1.

As we all know, spinning is a good trick. However, only the Chosen one can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost (but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived). The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach (based in Eastern philosophy on balance), giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin failed to maintain balance in the universe, symbolic of his fall to the dark side.

Anakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; all Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground. This is the only reason why ______ killed ______ in Rebels. This is also why Obi-Wan hates flying; in space, there is no high ground as there is no frame of reference from which there is a high or low ground, due to the lack of gravity.

In ANH, Vader proves his newfound mastery by engaging Obi on perfectly even ground. However, he lets himself die on the Death Star so that he could train Luke from a higher plane of existence.

(Why was Vader so invested in the construction and maintenance of the Death Star? Because he knows Obi-wan can't have the high ground if there's no ground left.)

In Return of the Jedi, you can see that the Throne Room contains a variety of different altitudes; Palpatine placed these there to ensure Vader's defeat. However, Sheev failed to realize that his weakness was no ground, and should have covered that gaping pit that does nothing.

In conclusion, Obi-wan abuses spatial relativity and Buddhist doctrine in order to invoke his high-ground powers.

well... just knighted... not really a satisfying kill...

I think they just should had used the cannon (and canon) folder jedi knights and masters that we don't see in the ROTS anymore for Grievous to kill (possibly few killed by other separatists like Dooku, Ventress and bounty hunters.)

I mean, it was sad that Grievous was portrayed as a clumsy and weakling while in the same time (before re canonizing everything) he was portrayed as excellent general (Not Thrawn level, but still pretty good) and a warrior with a passion (with revenge motive) and skill to kill Jedi.

What we got was very disapointing.

Just barely, but yes. It is chronologically before the original trilogy, even if the style and tone are very different. I mean, The Clone Wars memes are allowed. Not sure about Rebels though, that's closer to the time of Rogue One.

So I don't think BBY/ABY have anything to do with it. The question MAY be more relevant to r/sequelmemes because they have to debate whether Empire and Jedi count as sequels (to A New Hope)

Alright, a lot of this seems "true enough" yet I wouldn't go so far as to say it "rewrites brains". I would rather think of the "Will" of the force more like oceanic/Wind currents seen on planets with atmosphere. But it does make sense that the Force could be an all pervasive, ethereal being. ..

Weird, it's almost like a meme is an idea that spreds, sorta like a gene except for ideas. Hey, I wonder if we could apply this concept to evolutionary biology!

Oh, wait, that's where the word meme came from.

They kind of have to be if they're 40 episodes apart in the [official chronological order](http://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-clone-wars-chronological-episodeorder/), with Grievous, Ventriss and co. doing plenty of other things in the meantime. Not to mention once Heavy destroyed the radar station the Republic was alerted to the first invasion and the episode ends with Grievous calling a retreat.

Nathalie Portman is the reason I work out. I have this fantasy where we start talking at the Vanity Fair Oscars party bar. We exchange a few pleasantries. She asks what I do. I say I loved her in New Girl. She laughs. I get my drink.


"Well, see ya," I say and walk away. I've got her attention now. How many guys voluntarily leave a conversation with Nathalie Portman? She touches her neck as she watches me leave.


Later, as the night's dragged on and the coterie of gorgeous narcissists grows increasingly loose, she finds me on the balcony, my bowtie undone, smoking a cigarette.
"Got a spare?" she asks.


"What's in it for me?" I say as I hand her one of my little white ladies. She smiles.


"Conversation with me, duh."


I laugh.


"What's so funny?" she protests.


"Nothing, nothing... It's just... don't you grow tired of the egos?"


"You get used to it," she says, lighting her cigarette and handing me back the lighter.


"What would you do if you weren't an actress?" I ask.


"Teaching, I think."


"And if I was your student, what would I be learning?"


"Discipline," she says quickly, looking up into my eyes, before changing the subject. "Where are you from?"


"Bermuda," I say.


"Oh wow. That's lovely."


"It's ok," I admit. "Not everything is to my liking."


"What could possibly be not to your liking in Bermuda?" she inquires.


"I don't like sand," I tell her. "It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."

Speaking of asshole. We had a regular, nice lady loved her, and she came by one day during the afternoon rush and ordered 40 nuggets, fries, and like 6 mcChickens. Lo and behold we had to pull her up while we get everyone else. In pretty good time, we got her order done after she had come in TWICE to make sure everything was going smoothly, wasn't too weird since she likes to talk with us. But after we ran her food to her, we fucked up bad apparently. She came in screaming her ass off that when she made the order she wanted everything FRESH. While the nuggets were fresh the McChickens weren't (not old or anything). We asked her to give us another 5-7 mins to wait since this was a stupid order and by god, 5 mins passed and she tore up our place screaming at us again, threw a nugget at me and just left. 2 minutes later we had some fresh McChicken patties. I never saw her again :/

Anakin was too used to spinning, and thus couldn't flip properly - it was the wrong axis of spinning for him. Palpatine, of course, spins on another axis entirely.

I'd say for the most part, yes. Some people say it ironically, but most people, myself included, prefer the overall story of the prequels, even if the acting and dialogue are lackluster. And others don't even find issue with that. Really just depends though.

What do you dislike about ANH and Empire? I can understand not liking Jedi, but I'd easily put it above both TPM and AotC. I genuinely am curious why you like those two movies more than the OT trilogy. Personally, I find the story telling, acting, and sets to be much better than the prequels. I'd love to have a civil conversation about this. Usually when someone defends the OT or ST here they get downvoted into oblivion.

Spinning on your Y-axis is a defensive maneuver that helps to dodge fire; spinning on your Z-axis is a heavily offensive maneuver as when done right it lunges you straight at your enemies. Flipping on the X-axis, however, is a recovery move that in the right hands has the advantages of both, but is much harder to master.

At D23 this past week, they finally announced the rumored Star Wars section of the Disney Parks: Galaxy's Edge. It's essentially meant to be a completely immersive experience set in an outpost on a remote planet within the Star Wars-iverse. There, you basically role play as a character within Star Wars, flying the Falcon, getting caught in battles between the Resistance and the First Order, and even meeting certain characters like Kylo Ren and Hondo Ohnaka. The park should be completed in 2019, and if they can pull it off, I'd be super excited to go.

Through the glass, that's how I'm going out

For the Sith motherfuckers that's showing out

I saw a few prequel memes pop up on r/me_irl and I thought, "These are great! I wonder if there are more anywhere..." So, I stumbled around Google for a bit before I found this place. I've been here almost since the beginning (with my old account, anyhow) and haven't looked back!

No, it's really not. It's based on Space Opera serials of the 40's-60's like Buck Rodgers and Flash Gordon, about as far from westerns as you can get.

Also, Firefly is the definitive modern Space Western, and there's a shitload of science and realism in it. Kaylee talking about the viability of ceramic parts in spaceship construction, the constant need for food and fuel, how Vera is used in and out of atmo, the pacification gas on Miranda...

"Spider-Man, Spider-Man, 

Does whatever a spider can 

Spins a web, any size, 

Catches thieves just like flies 

Look Out! 

Here comes the Spider-Man. 

Is he strong? 

Listen bud, 

He's got radioactive blood. 

Can he swing from a thread 

Take a look overhead 

Hey, there 

There goes the Spider-Man. 


In the chill of night 

At the scene of a crime 

Like a streak of light 

He arrives just in time. 


Spider-Man, Spider-Man 

Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man 

Wealth and fame 

He's ignored 

Action is his reward. 

To him, life is a great big bang up 

Wherever there's a hang up 

You'll find the Spider-Man." - classic Spider-man theme

The only real reason I even like him is because of a conversation with my friends. I said I was the Han Solo of the group, and someone said I was more like C-3PO. After that, I started noticing my similarities: I'm a giant, ~~lovable~~, cunt

2017/07/22 - 01:56:36 New comment by: bobby123482
Basically, I just find the Old Republic as a whole more complex than the Empire ever was. I mean that's obvious seeing as, you know, the Old Republic lasted a millennium whereas the Empire was what, 30 years old when it fell? That's obviously going to open room for more lore and such. 

Also, the whole basis of the prequels was basically the Sith's rise to power after having lived secretly within society for centuries, and I think, again not the way the movie's necessarily portray it, but the way Plagueis, Palpatine, and Dooku masterfully destroy the Republic definitely makes for a much more developed story, at least, again, in my opinion. 

I just felt the simplicity of the OTs story, despite being good movies, makes them inferior to the Prequels. I mean, it can be simplified to 'blow up Death Stars and run with Yoda on your back'. Obviously, it's slightly more complex than that, but again, it's still simpler than the Prequels' idea of 'destruction of an entire society and rebuilding one on its ashes'. 

Again, that's just my 2 cents. You do you bud. But yeah, you might not wanna say anything like OT>Prequels here if you value your karma. :P

I agree with you, but it's the movies portrayal that ultimately matters to me. The OT gave me a story and characters that I cared about, the Prequels did not. I also like the aesthetic of the Empire over the Republic.

Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Stallman the FOSS?... I thought not, it's not a story Microsoft would tell you.  It's a GNU legend. Darth Stallman was a Leader of the GNU so powerful and so wise, he could use the GPL to influence the coders to create...Linux. He had such a knowledge of the GPL, he could even keep the ones He cared about...from being slaves to closed source programs. He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power...which, he still hasn't yet, but he probably will teach an apprentice everything he knows who will kill him in his sleep. That would be ironic.

No there still are Blockbusters out there. 

The only comics I really collect are the Canon Marvel Star Wars ones (which are good, when I said that recent Marvel comics were bad I was referring to their super heros) and the Titan Comic Doctor Who comics. Which is made up of several ongoing series for different Doctors (wether they are the current Doctor or not.) 

Batman vs Superman was awful. I watched it with my Dad, Grandma, and younger brothers. It was bad.

This is all wrong. He wanted it to be purple so he could be noticed in the battle of geonosis. If he had a regular lightsaber he'd be harder to see but with a purple one he'd stand out.

Oh wow I thought they're all gone. I remember last time seeing one was in 2012 I think.

Comics are really expensive. I only download the free ones from Marvel. 

Yup. But I think it's better than Man of Steel so that's something, at least. I haven't seen Wonder Woman yet but people are saying it's great.

Yup. It's  tragic act of terror but 15 years later the US has killed far more civilians in the middle east. Atrocities are committed on both sides in war. It's not black and white.

D.C. Films are dead to me. 

I actually thought Man of Steel was better.

Comics can be expensive, but I don't buy them one by one, I buy the tradespaper backs/ graphic novels, , which collect story arcs. I just finished the Kanan comic and read all of Lando. For the Doctor Who comics I have the first 10th Doctor graphicnovel and the first 12th Doctor graphic novel sitting on a shelf, I just have to finish them. All of these were good.

That's just nonsense. The new actors were great and there were plenty of practical effects in every location and nearly all the creatures. Not to mention it was beautifully shot. I like the prequels, but to pretend that the episode 7 is just garbage is stupid, you sound like the people that write off the prequels entirely.

People send Tumblr users hate for things without realizing they only reblogged them rather than created them themselves ALL THE TIME. I'm confident in saying OP reblogged the image, leading to the anon. Helps that she clarifies at the bottom that she didn't create it.

I have a friend whose followers are apparently dumb as rocks because she's been accused *multiple times* of stealing writing even though she only reblogged it.

It's a leveling war, Obi One knows that Maul knows that he knows that Maul has the high ground. Maul knows that Obi One knows that he knows that the best strategy is to just hang in there. Maul knows that Obi One is game theory optimal jedi and because of that he would never try anything without the high ground, but Obi One knows that so he deviates from the optimal strategy to beat Maul who clearly ends up underestimating Obi One thinking process. At the end is all mind games when it comes to the force.

It's the fate that /r/wholesomememes suffered. It became more and more popular and the new users diluted the content and then the mods let the users decide if comics should be allowed even though that was why /r/wholesomecomics existed and they pretty much went against the original spirit of the wholesome memes until it became hard to find a highly-upvoted post that wasn't a comic and oh God the run-on sentences that invited and now it's happening here

Have you heard the Tragedy of Anakin Skywalker the Powerful? I thought not. It's not a story the Sequels would tell you. It's a Prequels legend. Anakin Skywalker was a Knight (not Master) of the Jedi, so powerful, and so bold, that he could use unconventional military strategy to influence the Republic army to create victories... He had such a knowledge of Republic and Separatist capabilities that he could even keep the Separatists from winning. The unconventional side of military tactics is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be risky. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing in battle, which eventually of course he did. Unfortunately, he taught his master everything he know, then his master almost killed him in his arrogance. Ironic, he could save others from harm, but not himself.

2017/07/22 - 05:20:41 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

She is still hot, even with a slug body.

Natalie Portman is the reason I work out. I have this fantasy where we start talking at the Vanity Fair Oscars party bar. We exchange a few pleasantries. She asks what I do. I say I loved her in New Girl. She laughs. I get my drink.

"Well, see ya," I say and walk away. I've got her attention now. How many guys voluntarily leave a conversation with Natalie Portman? She touches her neck as she watches me leave.

Later, as the night's dragged on and the coterie of gorgeous narcissists grows increasingly loose, she finds me on the balcony, my bowtie undone, smoking a cigarette.

"Got a spare?" she asks.

"What's in it for me?" I say as I hand her one of my little white ladies. She smiles.

"Conversation with me, duh."

I laugh.

"What's so funny?" she protests.

"Nothing, nothing... It's just... don't you grow tired of the egos?" I extend my lighter towards her, shielding it from the wind, then sparking it with a snap.

"You get used to it," she says, daintily blowing her first puff over her shoulder.

"What would you do if you weren't an actress?" I ask.

"Teaching, I think."

"And if I was your student, what would I be learning?"

"Discipline," she says quickly, looking up into my eyes, before changing the subject. "Where are you from?"

"Bermuda," I say.

"Oh wow. That's lovely."

"It's ok," I admit. "Not everything is to my liking."

"What could possibly be not to your liking in Bermuda?" she inquires.

"I don't like sand," I tell her. "It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."

Never should've been let out the wroshyr tree

Ice Chewb would like to say

That I'm a crazy Droidfucka from around the way

Since I was a youth, I shot bowcasters

Now I'm the Droidfucka hangin' with the Masters

Takin' a limb or two, that's what the hell I do

You don't like how I'm livin'? Well, poodoo!

This is a tribe, and I'm in it

My man Yay'll eat you up in a minute

With a X Y, X Y, you been had

And then you say: "E chu ta, they bombad!"

Everywhere we go they say: "Blast!"

W.W.A's nerfherdin' and are hairy-assed

And then you realize we don't care

We don’t just say "whoo," we’re too busy sayin', "roworaac!"

About drinkin' Garrmorl straight out the bottle

Do I look like a Droidfuckin' role model?

To a pup lookin' up to see

Life Debt ain't nothin' but Solo and me

'Cause I'm a walking carpet that can cause some harm

If you beat me at Dejarik I’ll pull off your arm

See, I'm no fuzzball 'cause I keep howlin'

Yo, it's Life Day - what are they growlin'?

There's a running joke in my family that we're descended from one of Hitlers highest ranking officers, and someone who would've been the next fuhrer of Nazi Germany if he wasn't prematurely killed before Hitler. No we are not actually related to him. If we were, I'm fairly certain we'd be in a Russian Gulag or German Federal Prison. He died with no offspring in the 30s. He is a true insult to our family name, but makes for a good joke. :P

Maybe it isn't the best example, I actually really hate /his/ personally, it's like trying to talk about history in a youtube comment section. Regardless, it's less extreme than other boards, so that's why I suggested it, but like I said, it's up to him to decide where he wants to go.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Senator Padme The Sad? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s an Ooba legend. Senator Padme was a spouse of a jedi, so powerful and so wise she could use her politics to influence the senate to create laws… she had such a knowledge of the legislative branch that she could even keep the ones she cared about from becoming unhappy. The legislative branch of the senate is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be... too liberal. She became so content with life… the only thing she was afraid of was losing her will to live, which eventually, of course, she did. Unfortunately, she turned Obi Wan against Anakin, then in his anger he killed her. Ironic. She could save others from sadness, but not herself.

It's pretty easy to answer though, I think. I'm in the camp that says Obi-Wan's line on Mustafar specifically refers to the scene in episode 1. Obi-Wan has meditated on that fight enough to know that Maul should easily have been able to defeat him, if he weren't prideful and arrogant enough to think Obi-Wan already defeated.

In this case, the episode 3 Obi-Wan (Obi-Three) would win against episode 1 Obi-Wan (Obi-One) because Obi-Three knows precisely what to do to best Obi-One in this situation.

Those factors are serviceable at least, which allows the novelty of the films to carry them.

TFA not only is the seventh film in a franchise, but also rehashes the entire plot of another film in that same franchise. That's about as far from innovative or novel as you get.

Well, there is no way it gets a sequel status, no matter what.  
You have know that there is a difference between OT(Original Trilogy) and the sequels. OT is 4-6, and the sequels start from 7. R1 is happening between 3 and 4, and it'd be stupid to add a new movie to a group called "Original Trilogy."  
So, there.

By definition a prequel has to have a setting that takes place before the original movie, and since Rogue One occurs before the events of A New Hope it is a prequel even if only by about 10 minutes.

A lot of fans don't realize this because they've never watched Star Wars in the original Japanese, but at the end of the battle on Mustafar in Part 3, Obi-Wan actually says "It's over, Anakin! I have 「ZA HAI GURAUNDO」!". He's warning Anakin about his Stand, which can end a fight in one hit if the difference in elevation between Obi-Wan and his enemy is big enough. He first awakened this Stand near the end of Part 1, and used it again in Part 3 during the "General Grievous Just Wants to Live a Quiet Life" arc; in the battle on Mustafar, it proves critical in defeating Anakin when he tries to leap over Obi-Wan, insisting "You underestimate my POWA!".

"Our greed and lust for karma have already done that."

Look at out top 3 posts. They're all "The Senate". If we stick to just one post it would have had 194k combined points, enough to put it into that chart.

But no! Greed and lust for karma of our members meant that the vast majority reposts, undermining the effort of OC makers like myself. If they're not with me, then they're my enemy.

A male Aleena from the planet of Aleen, the diminutive Ratts Tyerell took on the role of a professional Podracer pilot, making up for his small stature with a Podracer with large, oversized engines.[1] Utilizing a team of Aleena mechanics, Tyerell toured alongside his family. Tyerell's profession earned him immense popularity on his homeworld, and was sometimes considered to be Aleen's most famous native.[1] A small toy based off of Tyerell's Podracer was also produced at some point. Tyerell eventually headed to the Outer Rim planet of Tatooine to participate in the world's largest annual Podrace, the Boonta Eve Classic. The race was concurrent with an invasion on the neighboring planet of Naboo. Only a little while before the race, Tyerell's wife gave birth to a third child, a fact that eventually found its way to the race commentators Fode and Beed

Why does this happen every single time someone posts a Rogue One meme? R1 is a prequel by definition, as it's a movie made later that comes before the original. It's also in our definition of the prequel era, anything that happens before the OT, as defined in rule 3:

>at least loosely related to anything in the Star Wars universe taking place before A New Hope

It also has the same actors for Bail Organa and Mon Mothma as the prequels. So, in all ways that most of us care about, it's a prequel.

As a plot device, not merely a reference. We have four SW movies (if you count Rouge One) where the plot centers around blowing up a huge laser the size of a planet/moon. I'd say TPM is close because the protagonists blow up a command ship to win the battle, but its destruction isn't the key element of the plot.

I think after reddit did this all the time, they reworked their algorithm to not give so much weight to highly upvoted posts.  It makes sense, considering the point of those posts is to manipulate the algorithm.

The top pic can be any number between 0 and positive infinity. The second pic can be any number between negative infinity and positive infinity. Both are unlimited yet the bottom pic is twice the unlimited. From the point of view of a number line, the top would start at center, 0, and head off in the right direction (a single bladed lightsaber) while the second starts from center, 0, and goes off both in the left and right directions (a double bladed lightsaber).

Maybe. But it is hard to manipulate a strong mind like Anakin's.
That wasn't my point though.
Dooku had every chance to escape, yet he did not. I can understand such behavior from a Jedi (hoping that Anakin will spare his life), but not from a Sith.

In high school I'd lose pencils all the time so my dad bought me a giant bag of like 50 mechanical pencils from business depot.  They were a distinctive shape and yellow colour.  I'd lose them throughout the year and see people in my class with them.  Eventually I lost all of them but the next semester I saw guy in my new class with one.  I hadn't had any classes with him the previous semester.

Rule 3 states that it doesn't to be a part of the Prequel Trilogy to be considered a prequel, it just has to be before a New Hope. The official rules of this sub define what is considered prequel on this sub, not your own version.

I love the EU but in 1977, before any of that jazz was written, I really think George Lucas was just trying to paint a simple picture with large, galactic themes. I don't think he was writing star wars with the whole policital spectrum in mind. When Hitler became Chancellor, there was still a Parliament and the NSDAP was still just a party. Of course, they assasinated the opposition slowly and gained more and more seats but it's all very simple dirty politics. It's exactly what you said, everything OUTSIDE of the movies paints a complex story. Star wars originally was not a complex story.

What else would you call it if you, say, went to a planet with a very different atmosphere generated by some lifeform there, and as a result of inhaling it you started experiencing immense moodswings, uncontrolled aggressive tendencies, extreme cynisism, narcississm and antisocial disorders along with adopting a "might makes right" philosophy, even having shown revulsion towards all such things previously, and it affects everyone who succumbs to it in precisely this way?

It clearly rewrites brains to at least the same extent as longlasting abuse of hard drugs does.

Karma doesn't scale 1:1 when you get a post with lots of upvotes. The more upvotes that a post/comment gets, the smaller the ratio of karma that is actually added to the account.

Because the context of it is that this guy wants Palps to show up when people google the senate. It's a joke. And google absolutely should filter jokes out. Such as when people upvote a picture of the nazi flag under the title "Comcast". No one wants to see that image when they're actually googling Comcast. People don't want to see a fictional character when they google the senate.

What about the droid attack on the wookies?

2017/07/22 - 23:14:10 New comment by: LuminaRed
Obi-Wan doesn't need to be on the high ground, the high ground just needs to exist in the battle; Obi-Wan knows that when he has the low ground, he really has the high ground, from a certain point of view. Look at his battle record:

Maul: Has low ground, wins

Dooku: No high ground, loses

Greivous: Has low ground, wins

Vader: Has high ground, wins

Vader rematch: No high ground, loses

Obi-Wan with the high/low ground is canonically the most powerful Jedi. This is fact. Had Yoda not denied his request with typical Jedi arrogance, he could have beat Palpatine in the Senate building, which housed a variety of different altitudes; this so that the Chancellor could always have the moral high ground in Senate debates. But Obi-wan didn't fight Palpatine, and Yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the Sheev in a normal 1v1.

As we all know, spinning is a good trick. However, only the Chosen one can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost (but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived). The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach (based in Eastern philosophy on balance), giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin failed to maintain balance in the universe, symbolic of his fall to the dark side.

Anakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; all Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground. This is the only reason why ______ killed ______ in Rebels. This is also why Obi-Wan hates flying; in space, there is no high ground as there is no frame of reference from which there is a high or low ground, due to the lack of gravity.

In ANH, Vader proves his newfound mastery by engaging Obi on perfectly even ground. However, he lets himself die on the Death Star so that he could train Luke from a higher plane of existence.

(Why was Vader so invested in the construction and maintenance of the Death Star? Because he knows Obi-wan can't have the high ground if there's no ground left.)

In Return of the Jedi, you can see that the Throne Room contains a variety of different altitudes; Palpatine placed these there to ensure Vader's defeat. However, Sheev failed to realize that his weakness was no ground, and should have covered that gaping pit that does nothing.

In conclusion, Obi-wan abuses spatial relativity and Buddhist doctrine in order to invoke his high-ground powers.

Have you ever heard the tragedy of Darth Downvote the Just? It's not a story the mods would tell you. Darth Downvote was a dark lord of Reddit so powerful and so wise he could influence r/PrequelMemes to control r/all. He had such knowledge of their unlimited powah, the only thing he was afraid of was losing their place at the top of r/all, which, of course, he eventually did.
However, in the final revenge of the sith lord, he influenced r/PrequelMemes to downvote the rest of r/all.

But it doesn't show up at all on all time - Reddit doesn't think it's actually not that high up, it straight up doesn't think it exists. Except it does show up as the top post of all time for some people, including me, now, but others are still saying they can't see it. It can't be a fault with the algorithm unless the algorithm is literally randomly deciding whether it should show it.

tl;dr: Reddit's drunk.

Turmoil has engulfed the African Republic. The taxation of SAND trade routes to outlying countries is in dispute.

Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Sand Federation has stopped all shipping to the small country of Naboo.

While the congress of the African Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor Kofi Annan has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the guardians of sand and justice on the planet, to settle the conflict....

That's because the way votes are calculated and displayed has been changed in the last year or so several times. [One post back from December](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5gvd6b/scores_on_posts_are_about_to_start_going_up/) about it. They've experimented with a few different implementations so far. The numbers are not only fuzzed to help fight spammers but in general are entirely incorrect for high voted on submissions.

The numbers are never accurate at face value. They never have been.

Obi-Wan doesn't need to be on the high ground, the high ground just needs to exist in the battle; Obi-Wan knows that when he has the low ground, he really has the high ground, from a certain point of view. Look at his battle record:

Maul: Has low ground, wins

Dooku: No high ground, loses

Greivous: Has low ground, wins

Vader: Has high ground, wins

Vader rematch: No high ground, loses

Obi-Wan with the high/low ground is canonically the most powerful Jedi. This is fact. Had Yoda not denied his request with typical Jedi arrogance, he could have beat Palpatine in the Senate building, which housed a variety of different altitudes; this so that the Chancellor could always have the moral high ground in Senate debates. But Obi-wan didn't fight Palpatine, and Yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the Sheev in a normal 1v1.

As we all know, spinning is a good trick. However, only the Chosen one can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost (but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived). The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach (based in Eastern philosophy on balance), giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin failed to maintain balance in the universe, symbolic of his fall to the dark side.

Anakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; all Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground. This is the only reason why ______ killed ______ in Rebels. This is also why Obi-Wan hates flying; in space, there is no high ground as there is no frame of reference from which there is a high or low ground, due to the lack of gravity.

In ANH, Vader proves his newfound mastery by engaging Obi on perfectly even ground. However, he lets himself die on the Death Star so that he could train Luke from a higher plane of existence.

(Why was Vader so invested in the construction and maintenance of the Death Star? Because he knows Obi-wan can't have the high ground if there's no ground left.)

In Return of the Jedi, you can see that the Throne Room contains a variety of different altitudes; Palpatine placed these there to ensure Vader's defeat. However, Sheev failed to realize that his weakness was no ground, and should have covered that gaping pit that does nothing.

In conclusion, Obi-wan abuses spatial relativity and Buddhist doctrine in order to invoke his high-ground powers.

"mustn't have cared" and "must've not cared" would both be correct

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_English_contractions

The question is could you double contraction and go with "mustn't've"

The rule of improv comedy is 'Yes and'. Which basically means when someone introduces a concept into the scenario, no matter how wild, you do not dismiss it.

You can see this concept a lot in Whose Line. 

>Naw, it's cross stitched not tattooed on his face.

You're just not playing the game correctly, and therefore the downvotes.

Once you stitch something, you have to either backtrack and undo each stitch or tear them all out if you've gone too far to go back. When you've spent hours stabbing something hundreds of time, it's really heartbreaking to have to tear it out stitch by stitch. Cross stitch is really slow

Its a real problem in hawaii. The tourist industry is centered in waikiki, but that land was originally marshlands. They were pretty, but they filled it with concrete and made it into a tourist beach. Since its actually a marsh with sand covering it, the ocean basically pulls the sand out to sea at a rapid rate. Some of the sand is from the north shore beaches, but the rest is inported from australia.


Tldr: this is what you get for tampering in the Lords domain...

No, I'm mostly making a comparison.

If you had the effects that the force causes on its users, but it came from alien spores and pheromones instead of an omnipresent energy field, we'd definitely say that those pheromones were altering people's personality and controlling their minds, and not in a benevolent or minor way, but in the way that decades of abusing crack or other extremely mentally poisonous drugs changes a normal person.

OH, like these things I heard  about recently. Think their called "Kairomones". Their a lot like Exo Pheromones but instead of having a mostly positive effect on the behavior of another species, it mostly effects another species behavior negatively. That's IRL btw. If the force is something like this, an all pervasive emanation of a cosmic beings body odor, or even the beings consciousness *itself*! Holy shit. A cosmic symbiotic  entity that gives evolutionary advantages to those sensitive to the signal in exchange for feeding off of the sentient species cognitive output/surplus and gaining access to a way to manipulate matter in the physical world. Disturbing! Reminds me of something irl...

makes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel
dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the fart you should
never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that fart
will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting

Maybe:

1) It's a violation of reddit rules (ask for upvote).

2) Seeing you posted on TD, the admins are bigots.

I'll iterate.

Here on r/prequelmemes three different "the senate" posts topped how many others, all made by those reposters who hoped to cash in on the karma. As a result, the upvotes are divided amongst the three. If we were to stick to just a single post it would have had almost 150k points, and probably a chance to be on first page of r/all.

Meanwhile, r/movies did it for April fools, and there is only one "the senate" post because of the limited time window to shitpost such things. As such it doesn't suffer the problem of doot splitting like we did, and adding to it's large normie userbase it could rise to the top.

What I've always wondered about those holograms is how do they sit in the Jedi temple chairs? Either every Jedi Master on the council carries an exact replica of their chair wherever they go so they can hologram from it, or the holograms aren't actually representative of the Jedi they portray. Shit like this keeps me up at night.

2017/07/23 - 16:39:44 New comment by: thatguy5748
That's like saying they should have made Star Trek 5 because otherwise there'd be no Star Trek 6. They're just numbers, they don't mean anything. And with Star Wars, especially, everything is mutable. They could just say the prequels never happened and erase them from their catalog, and no one would care. If they're willing to mutilate the original three, there's really no limit to what they could do with the prequels.

2017/07/23 - 16:45:15 New comment by: dmkolobanov
My point is that since they made the original trilogy numbers 4, 5, and 6, it only makes sense that they make prequels. If they'd called the OT 1, 2, 3, I wouldn't say that the prequels needed to be made. But the numbering system set it up for prequels.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of /u/14th_Eagle  "the wise"? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. /u/14th_Eagle was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

1981 was after ESB, which was originally just called "The Empire Strikes Back" with no episode number. But I get your point regardless. It's amazing they let him announce a prequel trilogy before the first was even finished, and that he took 16 years to get to making episode 1 

2017/07/23 - 18:33:33 New comment by: WebbyUrchin
Another comment from him in that thread:
****
wow nice, I have something to admit. Ever since 1999 I have been having sexual fantasies of JarJar Binks. It all started when my grandma took the movie theater. As I watched Jar Jar swim through Lake Paonga I couldn't help but feel an intense pain in my heart. I felt alive for the very first time. I felt sick as we left, but also with an intense love for the Gungan native, Jar Jar.

I constantly thought about him. I re-watched the movie dozens of times. I would sit for hours and just watch over and over. Each time I felt closer to the galaxy far far away of Jar Jar Binks. My parents started to worry about me so they tried throwing the movie away but I was so enraged by this that I swung and hit my mother violently over and over. After this I was taken to a psychologist where I was found to be a high-functioning autistic. It was around this time that I had experienced my first sexual desires. I wanted to rub my penis on Jar Jar's fins. I wanted to lick Jar Jar's tongue, and kiss his nose.

I was experiencing virgin homosexuality through Jar Jar Binks the Gungan military officer. I began to draw dozens of homosexual pictures between me and Jar Jar. I remember watching pornography with my grandpa. This is what the pictures were based off of. I had drawn Jar Jar with a vagina and a penis and me. When my dad found the pictures he hit me right across the face. I cried and tried locking myself in my room but he kicked the door down and hit me and screamed at me. My dad threw away all of my copies of Star Wars: Episode 1 and even went as far as selling our dvd player.

After this I stopped talking to other people. I did not speak to anyone for 3 years, I was simply too traumatized by this event. I was 11 years old. Once I was allowed access to a computer I immediately started searching for pictures of Jar Jar. With my discovery of rule 34, I have been masturbating to the select few pictures of Jar Jar available.

Has anyone had this obsession with a film character?﻿

While the film was always called "The Empire Strikes Back" in promotional materials, the opening crawl of the original movie called it Episode V. And the reason the didn't rename "Star Wars" to "A New Hope" until 1981 is because they didn't re-release it until then.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?

2017/07/23 - 20:14:14 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

I got them when I had already read pretty much everything else that looked interesting. Most of them are used copies that were sorted out by American libraries (which gives them a bit of extra charm imo).

I got into Star Wars through Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy on PS2. I played through the OT in Lego before ever watching them. Then I watched the Prequels (there was a little bit of time between me watching AotC and RotS for the first time, so I bought the RotS novel first). After rewatching all the movies multiple times I wanted to know how the story continued.

The timeline in the RotS novelization showed the Thrawn Trilogy as one of the first stories after RotJ, so that's where I started...

...and now I'm here.

OT has simple story, just well executed and doesn't dare to bite more than it can chew.  *But you can't build universe around OT.*

Prequels are deeper but there is dispersion philophy & theme wise and would have been better as SW Bible which would get partially adapted to movies .


Just IMO.

2017/07/23 - 22:14:37 New comment by: JustinianKalominos
Nope. I genuinely believe they are well done movies, with good dialogue, pacing, story development and cinematography. I really don't share any of the usual complaints about Jar Jar (whom I like), CGI (which I never notice), dialogue (which seems fine to me), and story (which I like, particularly the political parts).

All in all, I think the Prequels have nothing to envy from the Originals, and the story they tell is well told.

They may have been poorly executed, but they add so much depth to the universe and establish so much lore, plus some of the best non-movie material has spawned from the prequels. The franchise would be dead without the prequels, people opinions be damned.

>Do all of you guys actually love the prequels this much?

Yes, there is an entire generation who love the prequels however we have been silenced by the older OT fanboys who have hated on our movies our entire lives.

 These OT fanboys have been led by their fat leader Mike from Red letter media, who pathetically built his company off a base of unfounded hate for the prequels. 

My brothers and I always loved the prequels and there is so much to love, they are so awesome. I remember seeing episode one in theatres in 99' and it blew my fucking mind. The pod race scene is up there as the coolest thing I've ever seen in a theatre,  and this was the same year the Matrix came out too. The end light saber fight with Maul is just the icing on the cake. 

I feel episode 2 was the weakest, but it was redeemed by Revenge of the Sith. 

I love the prequels as much as I love democracy and the republic.

Because even though the Jedi have spent a long time protecting senators and Senator Amidala in particular, and it's pretty obvious that she's pregnant (at least to Obi-Wan), why should they bother getting her into a doctor for a scan so she's, you know, less likely to die? Because a Senator dying would cause tons of trouble for the Republic, her particularly dying would hurt chances of peacefully ending the war, and it should be pretty obvious from AotC (at least to Obi-Wan) that Anakin doesn't want her to die - but, eh, who cares if she dies?

I'm tempted to make a bot that replies that to all bots - usernames with "bot" in them (except itself) with a list of added names and a blacklist users that unfortunately have "bot" in their names can add themselves to - with that. I feel like it's needed given the droid attack on the subreddits. And then I probably need it to delete its downvoted comments so it doesn't take over Reddit itself.

It's a prequel because it comes before the OT. EP 2 is technically a sequel to EP 1 but it's still a prequel in the big picture because it takes place before the originals.

I gotta be honest, I had less of a reaction from Rogue One than from the prequels, which after Force Awaknes actually don't look so bad anymore. At least they went to new places and didn't follow the same plot.

I thought not. It's not a story the stingrays would tell you. It's an Australian legend. Steve Irwin was a Crocodile Hunter of Australia, so powerful and so wise, he could use the wildlife to influence television stations to create shows... He had such a knowledge of the outback he could even keep the crocs he wrangled with from killing. The dark side of nature documentaries are a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his audience everything he knew, then a stingray killed him during a dive. Ironic. He could save himself from apex predators, but not stingrays.

Copy Pasta-ing what I posted in a previous comment

>I honestly think it's got to be Darth Plagueis. Star Wars knows how annoyingly small its vast universe is and that they can't just have a new character. Each character has to be related to a previous movie and/or the Skywalker family. Knowing this they'd know that people would be pouring over the previous films to look for similarities so they couldn't have anyone who could be seen in the previous films, yet it is Star Wars so as mentioned it still has to be someone from the previous films. Plagueis, admittedly, was "killed" by his apprentice (it's not a story you would have been told by a jedi) however he is also the only person in the movie universe who could "save others from death, but ironically not himself". Honestly, not a deal breaker since Snoke looks like a fucking corpse (especially in the concept art/cgi of him with his ribcage etc). Maybe Plagueis saving himself from death didn't mean not dying, simply not becoming part of the force and instead possessing his own body after Palpatine killed him. We know that Plagueis was Palpatine's master, therefore probably had ties to the Empire and it's resources. Snoke's robes look like a jedi/sith lords. He'd have motivation for dark side shenanigans. Kylo would respect him and could have been turned by him against Luke especially since Plagueis/Snoke created Annakin (Kylos idol). For real it just comes down to Star Wars' close minded approach to characters all needing to tie together despite the massive universe and knowing they could only use someone that was referenced but not directly shown. Plagueis fits that bill and is dark side.
Also get the fuck out of here with extended universe theories, that shits garbage not just because it isn't canon anymore but since they want the movies to be self contained for it's mass audience which is people that only know the movies.

A taxi to the airport from the hotel I work at is about $25 while an Uber is between $6 and $10.  Every day people ask me, "can you call me a cab?"  I say, sure, they charge $25 just so you know.  Shocked, they say "NEVERMIND, UBER IS SO MUCH CHEAPER!"  

I always wanna point out how dumb that is.  Of course it's cheaper.  That's the whole business model.  These people are business men/women that have been flying into cities and taking taxis for years, and now that Uber exists they're surprised when a cab is more expensive?

Where was Thrawn mentioned in the Star Wars cinematic universe. I know fans of EU consider him one of the most interesting characters along with Darth Revan etc. but Star Wars is owned by Disney. If it's not in the theatrical movies it don't mean shit since you can't make toys, backpacks, action figures, textiles etc. based on the other stuff. So unless it's mentioned in the cinematic universe I don't think it's a Snoke contender, even stuff in the side projects like Rogue One or the upcoming Han Solo shitshow won't count since Snoke is part of the core *Skywalker storyline* and they don't want to dilute that with an expanded universe within this setting of thousands of alien species and planets. Don't think of Star Wars as a sprawling space epic, think of it as a intellectual property that is dependent on the journey of the hero and familiarity on a global scale.

I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

Because nobody thought of that?

Maybe they assumed someone else was the father and that she went to a doctor for check-ups regularly herself.

And when the war is about to end a petty little senator can't do much anymore.

And how should they have known there was a danger ("She seems to be in perfect health.")

p.s.: In Legends, Leia can feel her twins and tell them apart long before they are born. I guess Obi-Wan never bothered to inspect her belly through the Force.

Maybe he did, just not very well. "Anain's the father, isn't he? I'm so sorry." Or maybe he just decided it was pretty obvious something was going on during the Clone Wars, who knows.

Actually, Coruscant is an Ecumenopolis, or a planet that is completely covered by a massive city. So saying Coruscant is your city would make sense.

To make it more Jake Paul appropriate, you should say "Republic Space is my city".

**Trinitite**

Trinitite, also known as atomsite or Alamogordo glass, is the glassy residue left on the desert floor after the plutonium-based Trinity nuclear bomb test on July 16, 1945, near Alamogordo, New Mexico. The glass is primarily composed of arkosic sand composed of quartz grains and feldspar (both microcline and smaller amount of plagioclase with small amount of calcite, hornblende and augite in a matrix of sandy clay) that was melted by the atomic blast. It is usually a light green, although color can vary. It is mildly radioactive but safe to handle.

Actually, that's kinda how Tatooine became a desert planet. The Rakata commenced an orbital bombardment, which fused the silica from the soil onto glass and boiled the oceans. Then the glass eroded into sand.
That actually means Krennic just created more sand for future generations

Have you ever heard the tragedy of DJ Plagueis the Fresh?

I wouldn't think so, it's not a story the Inklings would tell you, it's an Octarian legend.

DJ Plagueis was a Dank DJ of the Octarians, so powerful and so fresh he could use E-Liters to influence the rankings to create salt…

He had such spicy beats that he could even keep his team from splatting. The dank side of the Ink is a pathway to many ability chunks some consider to be OP.

He became so fresh… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his freshness, which eventually, of course, he did.

Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice splatted him in Moray Towers. 

Ironic. He could save others from being cooked, but couldn't stay off the hook himself.

I'm the for person in line to point out the flaws, lies and hypocrisy of the Jedi, but we should recognise that there is more to this. 

After all, Anakin did kill friends, children and his wife. 

He killed his wife who was his main motive for all the other killing and such. That doesn't make him evil. That just makes him an idiot.

It was multiple beams, not a single beam that split. The planets the beams hit were relatively close to each other in comparison to the beam's origin so they didn't show much divergence until they got closer to the target planets.

[Here is the scene from the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgLgpcKK7hc), at 13 seconds you can see multiple distinct beams inside the "one big beam"

Having a crappy life is no excuse for murdering children... 


An argument could be made for why the jedi order had to go, but there is no justification for when he hunted down a jedi that had take. The baresh vow ( its this thing in the new cannon meant to make the jedi seem more monk like where a jedi exiles himself from the order and forbids themselves from interference in jedi order business.) this particular jedi even withheld from reacting to the purge.

Jokes aside, this may convince some that the academic peer review community is full of fools or shills. While that may be partially true, the author themselves say:

> So does this sting prove that scientific publishing is hopelessly broken? No, not really. It’s just a reminder that at some “peer reviewed” journals, there really is no meaningful peer review at all. Which we already knew, not least from previous stings, but it bears repeating.

Considering the one from like a month or two ago had no little effect I doubt it. It was called "The Conceptual Penis as a Social Construct" and it used an online generator for part of it, it was intentionally pointless, it constantly contradicted itself  and literally used sources from a fake scientist called "S.Q.Scameron" and still got published after going through multiple peer reviews and editors.

He's looking at it from a Marvel perspective. I can understand the confusion, as Disney owns Marvel and built the MCU from the ground up, but when they bought Star Wars there was already a preexisting universe, and while Disney did a soft reboot of the EU, all of the stuff that had been previously mentioned in the movies and Clone Wars stayed canon. The new Thrawn book takes place in the same universe as Empire Strikes Back or Phantom Menace while in the MCU things don't necessarily line up with the comics, which is why even though they're owned by the same company you can't really compare them.

Not only do they not line up, they're in an entirely different universe! But Disney is smart. In the upcoming Infinity War they will make Thanos use the Infinity Gauntlet to tear open a portal to the Star Wars universe to connect everything, and we will all live happily ever after.

Correct. When Anakin turned, according to the commentary, he did not know that Sheev was sending the Windu through the Window and he thought that Sheev was actually too weak. What was supposed to happen in his mind is that he disarms Windu, they arrest Sheev, and Anakin is in the right because Windu acted out of bounds. Which means that throughout the entire betrayal Anakin was in the right, naive and young, but in the right.



It was also supposed to be done in a way that Palpatine thought that he was on the good side for cleaning up the corrupt Senate.

The prequels have some serious **issues,** but at least they had interesting settings, ships, and story...  
 Unlike episode 7, which had a few interesting areas, and a load of visual rubbish, with poor lighting, and bland design, stuck to a rehashed story.

I can't speak for everyone, but I really do love the prequels, even though I understand that they are not good movies. And it's not a "love to hate" kind of love, or "love to joke about"- I truly love those films, they were a big part of my childhood, and they brought great depth to the Star Wars universe. In my opinion it's not contradictory to love something but also think it's bad.

Ah well I still get the feeling by the way Disney operates that unless it's a theatrical movie it probably can be removed from canon at will, though if they're pumping out merch with it that's another story. Disney's Star Wars is a toy/merch advertisement so that honestly makes it much more legitimate.

2017/07/24 - 14:40:08 New comment by: assasanlord
Star Wars so as mentioned it still has to be related to a previous comment.

2017/07/24 - 14:42:18 New comment by: Darkbro
I think a lot of the replies I'd been getting are still clinging to the idea that Disney gives a fuck about anything outside its movies or tv shows being canon. I think books don't mean shit to them and in Revenge of the Sith it never mentions his species so unless it does in one of the shows it's up for being whatever they want it to.

considering that among the Tuskens, he didn't just slaughter the men, but the women & children too, I think that it's meant to rhyme. Ya know, cuz the movies rhyme, or something.

This is also symbolic of when Luke defeats his father in RotJ, because he had to kill the child inside of himself as well. He had to look deep into his heart and realize that the farmboy who lived on Tatooine with his uncle is gone, and that those days of carefree innocence will never return.

I'd be pleasantly surprised if Snoke is a new character but the people in charge of Star Wars don't work that way. It's going to be some previously seen/mentioned character from one of the 6 movies, and since it's the internet people will already have been guessing it and they'll have implied at some point that persons wrong to keep suspense.

It was heavily implied in Revenge of the Sith that Plagueis and the Senate created life together using the force. Anakin is a force child, the two of them had a little midichlorian baby together before their divorce.

Actually it's kinda weird, Plagueis and Palpy were working on trying to gather enough force to create a weapon they could use but the force, sensing the malevolent intent of palps and plague, refused to do so and retaliated by conceiving anakin. This the whole immaculate conception thing. Fuckin weird.

Obi-Wan in the sequels said that the Force flows through you, partially controlling your actions but also obeying your commands. At least, that's how the Light Side works. The Dark Side, however, is a different beast entirely. We saw in the [Star Wars: The Old Republic "Sacrifice" trailer](https://youtu.be/Nzq9epS2b1A) that in your drawing of it, the Dark Side can push you to do things you never would have and might regret instantly when you are done.

Although we could also say Anakin was pretty much at "in for a penny" by that point. He knew he had to play the Dark Side's game to save Padme, and in fact would require considerable power himself since Palpatine talked about working together to find Plagueis' secret. Seeing the children might have even had his thoughts dwell on his unborn children, which would lead him right back to his visions of Padme dying.

Anakin *could* stretch and make a case that killing the children was a mercy. The Jedi had already taken them, and even 'killed' them in their own way. They were committed to the same unfulfilling life he just went through.

Top Anakin actually looks like he should imo, specially paired with the snarky grin. It fits his personality as a Jedi (at least how I imagine him, as opposed to a whiny brat), an overconfident rulebreaker with a good sense of humour and fun. I can imagine TCW Anakin grinning like that.

Bottom Anakin looks like a creepy man-child on his way to chop up some younglings.

Oh.

I feel like that would've been better served by having Anakin block Mace's saber as opposed to cutting off his hand. Sure, he's not thinking straight and all that, I get it, but in terms of communicating the intent to the audience it makes more sense to me, at least. 

Then again I guess being rational and forward thinking enough to prevent the death of Palpatine is hardly a good way to show him taking another plunge towards the dark side, so maybe there is no good answer here.

Nah, but seriously though, just let people enjoy what they enjoy. I've never understood why people feel the need to say 'Mine's the best, your one is the worst!' (even if I am guilty of this. Ironic) --- for God's sake, movies are movies, people will like what others don't. Yes, there are people who like Twilight. 

The only objectively bad movies are one with no production values to speak of, like the dialogue of 'The Room' (which is one of the best ironic films of all time, mind you). Say what you will about the delivery in the Prequels, but there is actually some really good lines in there. 

That, and Ewan McGregor can carry a film.

The red one he wore during his speech to the senate, when he declared his new empire, was a Sith robe too. He enjoyed wearing it, because he could dangle the truth in the Galaxies' face but nobody recognized it.

Didn't get to see Logan but heard it was good, even my friend that isn't really into comic book movies said "actually good" so yeah... 

I think WW was the first pretty good movie DC made and that hype of it just not being garbage lifted it up.

I was actually born around the exact same time but I still appreciate the prequels. Maybe it's just nostalgia glasses talking but I think they really expanded the Star Wars universe in a positive way. They also looked and sounded pretty great. The may not be perfect but I'd take them over The Force Awakens.

As a filthy casual prequelmemer, I'm not entirely sure whether or not a prequel quote just went woosh over my head, but I'll respond anyway:

1. I generally would never complain about historical inaccuracies in superhero movies, I'd really not. But in this case, man... they fucked up the WW1 setting so bad, it felt like they were trivializing one of the darkest chapters in human history. And while I can buy the "faceless evil Germans" trope in WW2 movies (although even there I'd say it's quite overused), I don't think that one really works in a WW1 context. Much less with our multi-ethnic (what's the deal with that, by the way... why is there a Native American?) band of heroes fighting for "good guy British Empire". Also... when Wonder Woman finally kills Ares and singlehandedly ends WW1, people lay down their weapons, start hugging, cheering... beautiful happy end! Except we all know everyone went at it again not even 20 years later, in just as cruel and gruesome a manner.

2017/07/24 - 21:21:59 New comment by: WikiTextBot
**Christmas truce**

The Christmas truce (German: Weihnachtsfrieden; French: Trêve de Noël) refers to a series of widespread but unofficial ceasefires along the Western Front of World War I around Christmas 1914.

In the week leading up to the 25th, French, German, and British soldiers crossed trenches to exchange seasonal greetings and talk. In some areas, men from both sides ventured into no man's land on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to mingle and exchange food and souvenirs. There were joint burial ceremonies and prisoner swaps, while several meetings ended in carol-singing.

If you're actually asking about this guy being blind, no probably not. Many people who are legally blind have some eyesight. Maybe he can only see in a narrow beam (there was a guy on American Idol like that years ago) or maybe his eyes don't focus very well, or numerous other possibilities. The stick is handy for people like this because it's hard to watch for things on the ground if it's hard to see. I've known people like this.

WW was certainly a good movie, I don't think anyone can take that away.

Typically any movie with a possible progressive slant automatically tend to get higher scores. Happened with Ghost busters, happened with Mad Max, Happened with Hidden figures, happened to almost any Artsy highbrow movie.

As for why, I would say there are two main reasons. First are the reviewers themselves. They almost all entirely progressive, so they going to relate to movie that seem to tackle progressive interests. Any movie that seems to challenge women, minorities, enviromental issues, or attack things like big business almost always get reviewed higher then they are actually worth.

Second I feel is a distinct difference between Audience of Reviewer. The average audience see 1 movie every few months. So its a treat. It something they dont get to experience all that often. A reviewer on the other has this a daily occurrence.

For example reason action movies get reviewed so low is because they are so plentiful and tends to follow same tropes. So we may go into Guardians 2 fresh, where a critic may of seen 10 other action movies that month. 

So when you get movie that seems to break that mold, it is refreshing to a reviewer. So more unique artful movies often get received a lot better.

It hard to really correlate review and ticket sales though. Low reviewed movies get tons of ticket sales like Pirates or Transformers. At same time many of the movies loved by critics are often shunned by movie goers.

WW was already a great movie in itself. The hype that critics were able to stir up only seem to ampify that. WW also seem to have a lot of grass roots support. Some of the first trailers for WW were kind of questionable but they had a lot of really positive fans who supported. I feel that positivity was infectious and got a lot of other people excited to see the film.

Where I agree Guardian 2 and Logan especially were better films. I can't say that WW was all that much behind. I am happy for WW, as I am happy for Logan for the success it achieved.

2017/07/24 - 22:28:33 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

Each of Palpatine's helpers in each film in the Star Wars prequels foreshadows a different aspect of what Anakin will become when he becomes Darth Vader;
Darth Maul - The deadly and merciless apprentice who enforces Palpatine's will as well as surviving a terrible injury from Obi-Wan and becoming a cyborg.
Count Dooku - The Jedi turned to the Dark Side desiring to bring order to the Galaxy and plans to overthrow his master.
General Grievous - The wheezing, heavy-breathy, Jedi-hunting Cyborg.

It's not a story 4 out of 5 dentists would tell you. It's an ADA legend. Darth Plaqueis was a Dark Dentist of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Flouride to influence the midichlorians to clean teeth... He had such a knowledge of the dental side that he could even keep the teeth he cared about from decaying. The dental side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his dental practice, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his hygenist everything he knew, then his hygenist killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from tooth decay, but not himself.

I don't think he does. The line "Consider the coconut"   is a lyric to a song where he tries to convince Moana to stay on the island because there it has everything they could ever need, the aforementioned coconut being an example of which. 

As for recommendations, I'd say you should watch it if you enjoy the "Modern" Disney films, have an interest in Polynesian culture, and/or enjoy coming of age stories. I personally found it to be one of Disney's better films. But that's just me.

"I'm just a simple man considering the coconut" is a mashup of two lines from both characters; Jango says "I'm just a simple man" in Attack of the Clones and the chief entreats Moana to "consider the coconut!" in his opening number. 

Jango did not talk about coconuts and the chief did not claim to be a simple man but the joke is that they are the same person, shown by juxtaposing their lines together.

Logan was rated R so that takes out most of the kid audience. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 did well, but it's still another MCU movie release so it won't be as hyped as an Avenger movie. Spider-man: Homecoming is the fourth movie with that characters in the last ten years so despite how good the film might be, people are kind of fatigued and the last Amazing Spider-Man movie wasn't amazing either.

Millennials aren't the fidget spinner's target consumers, though. Fidget spinners, while indeed popular with millennials, to an extent, are primarily marketed toward children. Millennials aren't children anymore. The millennial generation ends (depending on which metric you use) between 1995-2000. That means the absolute youngest millennial is nearly a full adult, not a child.

Midichlorians are a microscopic life form that eats Force energy and thus is more prevalent on Force users than non-Force users.  They "tell us about The Force," but they aren't The Force, which is a vague psychic energy that the Jedi explain the existence of via a mildly Eastern philosophy.

There are plenty more than three, but they use recurring melodies. Lin Manuel-Miranda, who wrote the music, also wrote Hamilton, and that musical uses the same pattern of repetition. Think of it as "Moana's theme," (see the line where the sky meets the sea) and so on, where each time you hear that melody, it means something in terms of the character's emotion.

I agree with the whole "thrown out the window" thing. If I remembered correctly, Steve Not Rogers literally just finishes his speech about how "I wish there was one bad guy to end the war, but there isn't" and she's still up on the roof when Ares shows up out of nowhere. What a way to immediately throw out your message.

So, like what exactly is the whole premise behind your writing? I was kinda thrown off. The only real complaint I have is that there is a Chiss which are almost unheard of in the galaxy at that time. You can keep one; after all Nuru Kumumjuma (however you spell it) and Sev'rance Taan and Iram Radique were all Chiss, but give some explanation.

Thank you for reading!

The idea is to explain how the drugs got aboard the rebels ship. It will become clear soon.

Point taken. That will be an interesting challenge. I guess I was too inspired by the SWTOR era. If all else fails I will have to set it there :D.

What about Mirialans? The only ones we see are Luminara and Barriss. (Which still puts them at two more than the Chiss we see.)

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?

2017/07/25 - 06:37:01 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

Yeah Logan is a masterpiece. It's the kind of film that only really could fit that character if you ask me. I mean, it has very strong similarities to The Omega Man and therefore probably I Am Legend (haven't seen it), but it's also a character study for Logan.

In Plagueis, Plagueis mentions the Jedi are wrong about the midichlorians. Don't remember exactly how but his understanding was why he could keep people from dying. 

The book isn't canon anymore I'm pretty sure but it's really good and offers a possible explanation.

2017/07/25 - 07:16:12 New comment by: shulkario
I personally loved Wonder Woman because it was a charming tale of an innocent heart of gold hero clashing with and adapting to the harshness of the war to end all wars. It's a character-driven film with a pretty safe plot (basically the first Captain America). I felt for Diana the whole way through despite her having superpowers. The movie gripped me emotionally and I was fully invested.

Guardians 2 felt like people venting about family issues to the point where it felt very unnatural. There was no compelling villain either (not to say the main plot twist wasn't pretty powerful). I was disappointed but didn't hate it or anything. 

Spider-Man felt like a by the numbers Marvel movie to me, which isn't a bad thing. I enjoyed it thoroughly, but it lacked the emotional impact I got from the original 3 and to a lesser extent the first Amazing Spider-Man. The humor was flat out distracting at times as well. I liked it a lot, but it never quite gripped me like Wonder Woman.

This post, and this guy having to even ask who Luke's uncle was, just made me realize that for the first time that Luke is basically not affected at all by his aunt and uncle's murder.

He just... never mentions it again. Never processes it, never goes through the stages of grief.

He just is all "meh" and goes on an adventure.

It's exactly that.

Siduous tells Anakin he can drain life to safe Padme.  Clear foreshadowing to him using the force to kill Padme to save Anakin. 

It's that stupid robot saying it's a broken heart that ruined it. Obi Wan and Yoda should have felt that it was the force killing her as in the end how do they even know Anakin has become Vader? As far as Obi Wan is concerned Anakin is a pile of dust next to Lava.

> The brilliance of this film

Lol, let's not get carried away here. It's a nice theory, and I'd buy it as an EU story. But let's not pretend there was some brilliant plot writing and grand plan by Lucas involved here. He has repeatedly argued that these films are for children. And if that's his stance as creator, then I am not going to buy any elaborate nonsense like that as something children are supposed to make as a natural conclusion based on what they saw in the movie.

If you do evil she tries to push your towards the light saying your violence is pointless, likea child lashing out. Your lust for causing suffering pointless and barbaric. Calling her "wholly dark-sided" misunderstands the whole point. The second one is about unintended consequences and that "kind acts" may not be kind at all because, much like the dark side example, they are done without thought.

>A boy is given a horse on his 14th birthday. Everyone in the village says, “Oh how wonderful.” But a Zen master who lives in the village says, “We'll see.” 'The boy falls off the horse and breaks his foot. Everyone in the village says, “Oh how awful.” The Zen master says, “We'll see.” The village is thrown into war and all the young men have to go to war. But, because of the broken foot, the boy stays behind. Everyone says, “Oh, how wonderful.” The Zen master says, “We'll see.”

Have you ever hear the tragedy of Chief Plagueis the Wise. I thought not. It's not a story the hot-dog dealers would tell you. It's a Kitchen legend. Chief Plagueis was a  Dark Master of the Kitchen, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence dishes... He had such a knowledge of the Dark recipes that he could even keep the ones he cared about from hunger. The Dark side kitchen is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then he tortured him to exhaustion. Ironic, he could save others from hunger, but not himself.

The movie leaves it ambiguous. Most people forget everything else the medical droid says: 

"**Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her. We don't know why.** She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies."

The first part is the relevant context. Medical science cannot explain her death, so "She has lost the will to live" is obviously a guess on the part of the droid. It cannot be taken as anything more than a guess, because there is no evidence for it; if there were evidence for it, the droid would not have said he could not explain the death.

I don't mind the character, but she completely disrupts Anakin's arc in the films. I always had the impression that he had been promoted to a Knight because of his war efforts, not because he was mature enough to mentor someone else. 

Hell, he's obviously not mature enough to mentor anyone else in RotS.

>we've fought him loads of times in the Clone War

This is just another example of how The Clone Wars show fucked everything up. They just had to include a big lightsaber fight every week to attract idiots to the show. Which ruins scenes like this in Revenge of the Sith where it's clear the characters aren't supposed to have met between then and their meeting in AotC. Another is, why was Grievous shorter than Anakin expected if they had fought before like on the show? Fucking stupid show 

2017/07/25 - 14:14:59 New comment by: SterlingEsteban
Don't remember the series that well, so could well be the reason.

However, I like the idea that the Jedi were expressly promoting their members because of their prowess in battle, that Anakin is one of them, and that training took a backseat. 

2017/07/25 - 14:17:11 New comment by: counterc
Absolutely! Let me use an example, lifted straight from the excellent Youtube channel [The Dragon Demands](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV3PgptMBNJlyBx_jg2TDHw?). 

One of the many things that makes no sense in the TV show is Robb marrying 'Tulisa from Volantis'. In the books, as he is grieving from the (supposed) deaths of his brothers,  he throws himself into the arms of Jeyne Westerling, knocks her up, and has to marry her for the sake of honour. Then, of course, the Freys see this as a betrayal of his betrothal to their daughter Walda, and kill him at the Red Wedding. The point in the books is that the boy-king who was set up as our noble hero is killed for exactly the same reasons as his father Ned: they were men of honour in a world of monsters.

In the TV show, Robb falls in love with another character, who only exists in the show, 'Tulisa from Volantis', and this is his ultimate downfall. Now, if it was just that the writers wanted to change his character to make him more interested in romantic love, rather than personal honour, that would have been basically fine. Different, but a valid artistic choice.

But from other aspects of the script that make no sense, and from looking at what went on behind the scenes, we can see that this isn't what happened. What actually happened was that the showrunners weren't thinking about character motivation at all, and simply wanted to give Richard Madden a romance plot to show off his acting talents and win him an Emmy. They gave so little thought to the ripple effect this would have on not just his character, but the rest of the story, that they ended up creating a whole bunch of other problems. For example, Tulisa claims she is from the elite House of Maegyr in Volantis, but this makes no sense: Volantis is built on apartheid, and her character has dark hair and eyes, not the white hair and purple eyes of the 'superior' Valyrian culture who make up Volantis' ruling class.

For a long time, this and other things that made no sense, confused fans, to the point that people started making up conspiracy theories. The leading wild theory was that 'Tulisa' was actually a Lannister honeypot spy, designed to get close to Robb and seduce him so she could access information and cause him to make mistakes. But when, by her character's death in the Red Wedding at the end of Season 3, they hadn't revealed any such thing, fans were even more confused, and realised that they'd just been making up theories to rationally explain things that *had* no rational in-universe explanation.

The key evidence was an interview with George R. R. Martin, the author of the books, in which he explicitly said that originally, Oona Chaplin *was* indeed cast to play a character called Jeyne (and indeed her physical appearance fits the description of Jeyne in the book). He went on to say that when he found out that the showrunners planned to change the characters and make their story about romance instead of personal duty and honour, he asked that they at least give him the dignity of changing her name and making her a new character altogether. But because the showrunners Benioff and Weiss were starting to show their complete disregard for transparency or accountability, they didn't let any of the rationale behind these changes be known to the fans and general public, and so fans spent huge amounts of time and effort making up wild theories to explain the mistakes and plotholes their awards-baiting had created, until eventually GRRM got annoyed at their bullshit and started dropping the hints that fans needed to piece together what really happened.

As I said, this whole thing is a very quick summary of The Dragon Demands' [excellent videos](https://youtu.be/NsWZcbJCi18) on this and many other questionable changes and incompetent decisions in the making of the GoT TV show. I may have got details wrong, and anything that doesn't make sense in my comment is just a result of me trying to quickly summarise a very in-depth, 4-hour long video by TDD.

I haven't seen it, or paid much attention to it to be honest. I've always disliked super hero films. I just kind of guessed it wasn't the tone that really suits WW1. 

I guess WW1 is such a great period to tell moving stories, and its been criminally underutilised. Every November 11th is a sobering experience when I look at the local memorial splattered in the family name "Wiblin".

An overarching theme in Wonder Woman is the true horror of war. And Diana, as an idealistic young woman from a sheltered island society, provides a surprisingly good vehicle for conveying that idea.

But I agree, WW being the highest-grossing WWI film only means that there aren't enough good WWI films. After all, there are plenty of good/popular films set in WWII that are not too serious; they're just not the most popular ones.

I mean, criticizing SW physics is the epitome of low hanging fruit. There are so many things in it that don't conform to any known physics or science in general that you either just take it for what it is, or don't watch it at all if it bothers you that much. Accept that you're a hard-scfi person and move on.

NDT is trying to use it as a jumping off point to show how physics work, but honestly in a tweet it just comes off as annoying. I mean, they made a functional BB-8 toy, and while engineering doesn't scale up or down without problems, BB's movement and construction is probably one of the smallest leaps of logic in SW tbh.

I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

They did filled her belly with sand or something to give the impression that the children died. This was to prevent Darth Vader from searching for the children. Not like he would have found them anyway if they didn't reveal themselves.

He's not criticising SW; he's using pop culture references to get people to think about physics.

It's not like he's trying to say that things like Starkiller Base or the force are unrealistic, because viewers understand that's all fantasy. He talked about the way BB8 moves on sand because most people wouldn't've seen that as abnormal.

Window kills him, 'cause he's to dangerous to be left alive.

anikan gets depressed, 'cause he cant save his wife from death and his only non-jedi friend died. he turns to drugs and dies years later in a dirty motel in the outer rim.

since anikan won't kill gunray, etc., the seperatists survive and the droid army stays active. Without a strong leader, the corrupt senators turn to the seperatists for a new treaty.

Without the support of the senate, the jedi stand no chance against the droids and will either die or go into exile.

At last, the CIS will rule the galaxy and we shall have .... peace.

You make it sound like Tyson's out to ruin SW for other people. Clearly that's not what he's doing; he's just using a well-loved character as an example to get people thinking about physics.

>BB's movement and construction is probably one of the smallest leaps of logic in SW tbh

Again, he's not out to debunk SW. Most people understand that things like lightsabers and blasters are fictional, but BB8's movement on sand is not something they'd give a second thought to. That's why he pointed it out.

I can't say enough how terrible that show is. Netflix should scrub it from their servers and fire anyone who had anything to do with that show. They should be absolutely embarrassed about it.

I think that's the point. Balance to the force doesn't mean only learning what the Jedi said and never questioning it. And yes, while sheev was wrong and used only the dark, he has a legitimate point here. Anakin was just too much of a sociopathic weirdo to learn the lesson.

Whether he's right or not is kind of irrelevant. He's criticizing an obviously-fake science FICTION movie series. Did somebody ask him "hey, NDT, do you think BB-8 could actually roll around on sand?"

If they did ask, then his response makes sense. If not, then why did he tweet this, if not to be nit-picky, and therefore worthy of criticism?

"But herrrr deeerrrrr Reddit just hates NDT"

Yeah, for reasons like this. If a person has received wide-spread criticism, maybe that person is worthy of the said criticism.

Query: Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"? Statement: I thought not. Clarification: It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. Definition: It's a Sith legend. Recitation: Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life. Explanation: He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the meatbags he cared about from dying. Observation: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. Commentary: He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Conclusion: Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice initiated assassination protocols. Mockery: It's ironic he could save other meatbags from death, but not himself.

I'm not sure its fair to call someone a dick because of him using a bad technique for getting his point across. It's one thing to say his tweets aren't doing what they think he is doing, its another to say that because of that, the guy is just an asshole all round. Unless you just don't like his personality, which of course is fair enough. 

Most of reddit doesn't say he is a dick because of his personality overall, they do it because of his personality in his tweets, which as I said is unfair. His intentions in his tweets aren't to outsmart everyone and be a smartass, its to trick people into talking about science when they are talking about their favourite sport, videogame, movie etc.

   Anyone else find this scene really hot? When this alien farts at Jar Jar? The alien just looks so feminine and sexy, and the way it farts and turns to him to flaunt it. Like it's inviting him to get closer for the next one. I first watched this movie when I was very young and I have masturbated to this scene so many times.

Are Star Wars physics the same as ours? We're in the same universe if it's to be believed that the "Galaxy far far away" is to be directed towards us, so our physics should be the same, but they obviously understand way more than we do as far as manipulating physics to their will. It's completely possible for bb8 to ride along on sand for all we know; maybe not with our technology, but they have freaking Lazer beams that blow up freaking planets!

Bill Nye without question. At least NDT is an actual bonafide scientist.

NDT can be cringier sometimes but I think that comes from his eccentricity, which is to be expected of people who are generally pretty intelligent.

Bill Nye just uses his face created from a *kids* science show to spew a lot of opinionated bullshit. He's the equivalent of an elementary school science teacher claiming to be a scientist. Sure, he understands some complicated concepts, but so do I, and I don't go by "32BitWhore the Science Guy."

A person worrying about anything is going to be basically harmless on a global scale. A collection of people who have taken power and are all anti-climate change is dangerous. As is a collection of people who are all anti-GMO or anti-Nuclear or anti-Cryptography or what have you. Generally speaking, a powerful group who denies clear science is going to be dangerous. 

I don't disagree that climate change is more pressing than most other issues. Although GMOs and Nuclear power are both, intentionally or not, tools for combatting climate change. 

I'm tired of people getting upset at the notion that anyone could insult the ideal left, with a right as bad as it is. The moment anyone dares to suggest that the left isn't quite perfect, and that we don't need to embrace them and give them absolute power for being the lesser of two evils, people accuse them of saying that the two groups are equal. The right is worse about science (and a bunch more) than the left. But you're not going to win over people from the right by saying that your side is perfect when they can plainly see that that's a lie.

I also personally thought he seemed rather smug in his *Cosmos* reboot.

He gets called out on Twitter because it's a public platform where people can reply freely - it's an easy place to call people out. Same reason our illustrious POTUS gets called out - except one of them is doing it on purpose.

That's true, but it's as true as saying "the left doesn't oppose nuclear power, they just want to be careful in proportion to the danger." 

It's taking the current, most moderate, version of the position without acknowledging the fact that the position was at one time much more extreme or that many on that side still hold the older more extreme view.

Honestly I've noticed Tyson making a lot of douchey assertions recently. I think he's aware of the internet fame he's received and it's not a good look on him. His stance on AI is nothing short of ignorant, and he condescends to people who have legitimate concerns. I'd say he's 5/10, not deserving of all the praise he gets.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Macintosh the Charged?  I thought not. It's not a story that Microsoft would tell you. It's an Apple legend. Darth Macintosh was a Dark Powerbook of the Laptops, so powerful and so charged he could use the adapter to influence the electricity to create... charge... He had such a knowledge of the electricity that he could even keep the phones he cared about from dying. The adapter of the electricity is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be... unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his iPhone everything he knew, then his iPhone drained him when he was put to sleep. Ironic, he could save others from 0%, but not himself.

I think I was wrong to use the word 'trick', I should have said something like 'normalise talking about science'. I think its a reasonable goal to want the general public to be interested in science, and how better to do that than talk about the science surrounding their interests.

>At any rate, I've seen stories like these as well as references to his tweets - although they're anonymous, coming from two people a year apart they match up pretty well.

This is new information to me. I will take them with a pinch of salt though, as every celebrity has similar sorts of stories about them. Not to dismiss them, they are definitely possible.

Tyson has without a doubt made done his share of getting people interested in science, which is commendable by itself. That is the main reason I feel people on reddit are being overly critical of him, and the reason I still like the guy's work and feel the need to defend him.

I can't say for sure, but I suspect it still should work on sand because of how big the base is. Imagine a ball that's 6 feet in diameter, and isn't crazy heavy. That ball will roll much better on sand than a bocce ball or something like that. The reason is more surface area touching the sand, so the ball sinks in the sand less(and a few other reasons). If it turns out bb-8 is large enough, it shouldn't be a problem.

> You make it sound like Tyson's out to ruin SW for other people.

No, I didn't mean to. I get that pop culture is a vector to discuss topics many consider dry and boring (not just science), that's totally fine. If he linked to a video or article that talked about it in an interesting way that'd be different, but to just take random pot shots on Twitter on pretty banal SW inaccuracies seems cheap to me.

There's plenty of other scifi that's either attempting to be "hard" that get things wildly wrong that probably do more damage to people's understanding of science than Star Wars. SW is fantasy, basically. Nobody is taking shots at Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings for scientific breaches in accuracy. SW is the same, it's just wearing a scifi jacket.

I actually think it's more interesting to do the reverse; rather than debunk SW science, try to use science to discuss how it could be possible, or approximate, knowing what we know. Like figuring out how much energy a real Death Star would have to put out to actually blow up a planet. Someone did it awhile ago and I read it and was amazed.

No, they do deny biological differences in sex. The left today does not accept that there is (as a group, not applicable on an individual level naturally) a difference between men and women, nor do they accept that there is a difference between the brains of men and women. This isn't social science (That field of academia has been swallowed entirely by the left), I'm talking about hard biological science.

The "real" BB-8 was built using Sphero tech. The SW tweet was correct.

A Sphero really cannot propel itself over sand. Neil was correct.

The puppeteers pushing the BB-8 robot on set were what propelled it forward.

The only incorrect tweet here was the fan who really thought a spero robot drove itself over sand without the help of humans.

Yes, literally everyone who's read about it for more than 5 minutes thinks that. Same with the brain. I live in Ontario, which to an American is essentially the USSR right now, we learned this shit in science class, under a liberal government in a public school. And guess what? They still do.

 Assuming all the left thinks otherwise is like a leftist assuming everyone on the right "literally thinks black people are scientifically proven to be lesser" or something. But they shouldn't, as that would be incredibly stupid. Are there a few people that are legitimately that dumb? Sure! Although we can probably find a lot to top even that if we tried.

I think that may be the point of what sheev is saying. You can't go full into the dark side, or full into the light. One must embrace both sides, the yin and the yang so to speak. Obviously sheev was a high functioning phsycopath so he was a bit of a hypocrit. But he is ultimately right. Made windu is a good example. The force is balance, both the dark and the light.

This isn't ghost in the shell. Humans can't just rip their own limbs off. Their hand strength would have to be greater than the ligament, tendon, and muscle connections throughout their arm. So great that the vacuum can't pull them out. GiTS addressed this in the Manga actually. Someone had an arm mod and lifted something to heavy for his organic body and the arm pulled off. 

I'm thinking people get a dislocation and that causes them to loose their grip and schllllooop, they are pulled into space. Or they are strong enough to not dislocate and can slowly pull themselves up. 

Maybe a steroid user who only does hand exercises but I won't go down that rabbit hole right now.

Really all my questions on this will be answered in the last Jedi I think. I know it's a dreaded sequel, but they seem to be going really damn hard into the "grey Jedi" (oxymoron I know) theme. All that's left is to see what happens I guess 

2017/07/25 - 19:43:02 New comment by: GeneralReposti
Obi-Wan doesn't need to be on the high ground, the high ground just needs to exist in the battle; Obi-Wan knows that when he has the low ground, he really has the high ground, from a certain point of view. Look at his battle record:

Maul: Has low ground, wins

Dooku: No high ground, loses

Greivous: Has low ground, wins

Vader: Has high ground, wins

Vader rematch: No high ground, loses

Obi-Wan with the high/low ground is canonically the most powerful Jedi. This is fact. Had Yoda not denied his request with typical Jedi arrogance, he could have beat Palpatine in the Senate building, which housed a variety of different altitudes; this so that the Chancellor could always have the moral high ground in Senate debates. But Obi-wan didn't fight Palpatine, and Yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the Sheev in a normal 1v1.

As we all know, spinning is a good trick. However, only the Chosen one can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost (but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived). The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach (based in Eastern philosophy on balance), giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin failed to maintain balance in the universe, symbolic of his fall to the dark side.

Anakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; all Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground. This is the only reason why ______ killed ______ in Rebels. This is also why Obi-Wan hates flying; in space, there is no high ground as there is no frame of reference from which there is a high or low ground, due to the lack of gravity.

In ANH, Vader proves his newfound mastery by engaging Obi on perfectly even ground. However, he lets himself die on the Death Star so that he could train Luke from a higher plane of existence.

(Why was Vader so invested in the construction and maintenance of the Death Star? Because he knows Obi-wan can't have the high ground if there's no ground left.)

In Return of the Jedi, you can see that the Throne Room contains a variety of different altitudes; Palpatine placed these there to ensure Vader's defeat. However, Sheev failed to realize that his weakness was no ground, and should have covered that gaping pit that does nothing.

In conclusion, Obi-wan abuses spatial relativity and Buddhist doctrine in order to invoke his high-ground powers.

Do they teach you that while on an individual basis women can be astoundingly brilliant (One of the smartest people I've ever met, was a PhD candidate I went out with for a while), as a group they're less likely to be interested in or suited for those fields of work?

That's not really that unbelievable given everything else... interstellar travel has existed for at least a thousand years by the time of the prequels, so the fact that there's an established lingua franca isn't too surprising. Also, Jabba needed a protocol droid because he couldn't speak the language and had difficulty understanding it, so it's not really universal.


Now the part about all the humans having British accents except for Anakin's more or less American accent and Jango's Australian accent... that's pretty unbelievable.

NDT usually doesn't care about about things like lightsabers and space travel since its theoretical. His main issue arrives when the film crew doesn't do justice to physics we understand. He made a comment about this in an interview, I forget with whom, but he basically said that those type of situations kind of ruin the movie for him. He can get behind sci-fi where its all made up, but to not take the care to make sure you get "real" stuff correct just seems lazy. Paraphrasing.

It's marketing for Episode VII, so they're at least furtively suggesting it. They played up the practical effects so hard with that movie because of the backlash from the prequel CGI, but Episode VII has more CGI than they do, it's just better CGI. Not that it didn't have any practical effects, it just wasn't the total return to OT-style practical effects that they advertised it as. Which is fine, right tool for the right job.

He *is* smart, but he's one of those people who thinks that because they're highly knowledgeable in one field, they know something about other totally unrelated fields. NDT is solid when he's talking astrophysics, but he's spouted off some seriously ignorant bullshit about other fields like history, for instance.

It's not "the vacuum of space" they're fighting against, they're fighting against the pressure of the escaping air in whatever chamber they're in. In the immortal words of Mel Brooks, the problem has gone from suck to blow.

High-pressure chamber = screwed. Low-pressure chamber = fine. Completely-depressurized chamber = no force at all. So it's not a given that any character could or could not survive, it's a function of how the ship was designed, how much air is escaping, how many different pathways the air has to escape, etc.

He's always been a piece of shit and fame never changed that. I remember a thread where someone from high school saved up 40k+ to have him show up and he was a fart sniffing asshole. He has really bad character and uses his influence to swing his dick at people doing real work in the world. 

Just the other day I heard him talking about how SpaceX was bound to fail because there's no way you could find sustainable cash flow from investors. 

My answer to that: 
Musk is a billionaire
SpaceX is bigger than investments

Seriously though, you'd think they *would* be smarter than that. The episode before that ended with Anakin and Obi-wan swapping their drugged drinks with some other pirate' non-drugged drinks, then on the next episode it just starts with them waking up in the cell, and the Admiral saying that they weren't expecting to be betrayed.

Lost a continuity, the writers have. How embarrassing.

I mean...all the Star Wars movies are about magic space ninjas that flip around and use swords made out of lasers that can clash into each other.  There's also no sound or fire in space. Also it doesn't make sense to program work robots to have feelings.  But you know, they're fun adventure movies so who cares?

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Pluto the Planet? I thought not. It's not a story NASA would tell you. It's a solar system legend. Darth Pluto was a Kuiper Belt Object so mysterious and so loved, he could influence the planet classification criteria to remain a planet. He had such a knowledge of the classification criteria, he could even save his fellow planets from being reclassified as dwarf planets. They planet classification criteria is a pathway to many types of celestial bodies, some consider to be unnatural. He became such a favorite planet... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his planet status, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught NASA how beloved a planet can be, then NASA reclassified him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save other planets from being reclassified as dwarf planets, but not himself.

NDT is full of himself and desperate for attention.  He doesn't really want to educate people, he wants people to know how smart he is.  People like him appeal only to those who are already interested in science and his entire attitude turns off the average joe; I'd go so far as to say he does a disservice to STEM by essentially telling people that if you're wrong then science nerds are going to be mean about it in petty ways.  Bill Nye, by contrast, had zero "look how smarter than you I am" attitude.

That's way better then if her boyfriend comes by, and kicks your ass because you're talkin' crazy to his girl. You're tryin' to explain it's just a some dank maymay you were layin' onto her, but he don't care cause he's too busy kicking you in the nuts and callin' you a faggot. So, you sink to the ground cradling your shattered testes while that fly honey you were tryin' to get with is shrieking to just let you go and to just go dance with her. He don't give a shit, he's treatin' your head like his own personal soccer ball while grunting a phrase you can't understand louder and louder.

This dude is just goin' wild, punchin' and kicking ever inch he can possibly get to. Rib's crack, bones rupture from your skin along your arms and legs, your pelvis has shattered like so many tea cups hurled across gram ma's sitting room on Gin Rummy night with Uncle Todd. You're lying on the ground vomiting out teeth and blood, when he grabs you by the shirt and lifts you up to look you in the eye. Still pukin' up your cheap ass Enchirito from Taco Bell and a quart of blood, you stare that mother fucker right in the eyes. He gets real close to you, his nose hair is practically tickling your upper lip, and whispers gently..."I am the Senate."

People deny science they are emotionally involved in. Science center that doesn't challenge who they are or their world view is widely accepted. I don't think it helps to say all people or all science of any type or group is denied.

[You should listen to his titanic story when you get the chance.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B6jSfRuptY) If you know him a little, it's clear he's just very passionate about scientific literacy. Considering how terrible scientific literacy is, even in the educated western world, this is a valid cause. 

In this case, any in many cases, he's piggybacking on pop culture to teach people physics. He's not going out of his way to be a movie critic. In interviews he clearly states that he is perfectly fine with terribly physics in movies, so long as those movies don't claim to be scientifically accurate. 

The man overall celebrates life and curiosity. The criticism he's getting in this thread is completely unjustified imo.

Can we stop using that sub? After the racist and discriminatory subs on this site, this has got to be one of the worst circle jerk there is. It's basically filled with people who feel they've got an absolute authority on the right amount of intelligence you can express. It's similar to people claiming everyone that anyone driving faster than them on the road is insane, while everyone who drives slower than them needs to speed up already, but with intellect. The sub has a weird way of expressing both a superiority complex over people who (in their minds) express common information as more special than it really is, while having an inferiority complex by trying to suppress the celebration of knowledge because apparently it upsets them if it's not expressed in the right way.

You're missing one important piece of the puzzle. It's fun.

Some people like to be critical. They enjoy thinking about whether or not things would work the way the movie shows them, and they're welcome to discuss those things. If you're not interested in the discussion, don't join it.

I loved this. It was almost like they forgot they were supposed to be mad at each other, and then a cutscene rolls around and they're like "oh yeah we're fighting".

By the time you can actually afford all the stud multipliers, you don't need them anymore. I find the x2 and maybe x4 are relevant, but everything else after that is just fun for maxing out the counter.

Nah, what you gotta do is save up for the x10 modifier right off the bat, then get that and maybe a x2. All the in-betweens are unneeded.

2017/07/26 - 12:09:48 New comment by: agha0013
Depends on the game, I find. Some of them cost far less, like the Harry Potter games, where X2 is 250k, and X4 is 600k, with those alone it's easy to get everything you need. 

Star Wars starts expensive, and saving up for any of them can take time.

I never said anti-vaccine nutbags were *solely* left-wing. Check out any page such as Spirit Science or The Mind Unleashed; they're crackpot conspiracy sites that prey upon well-meaning liberals and they constantly preach about chemtrails, vaccines and occasionally the underground alien war beneath Dulce, New Mexico.

The Senate wasn't trying to assassinate Padme. He was trying to *fail* at assassinating Padme, so that he would drive her closer towards her faithful defender, the brave Anakin Skywalker.

So the Senate made the assassination needlessly obtuse and with a high chance of failure. Turns out his 4D chess moves paid off, because it resulted in having Skywalker in his pocket.

It's a Xanatos gambit. If Skywalker succeeds, his relationship with Padme deepens. If he fails & she dies, then the opposition to military escalation is dead. Either way, Palpatine wins.

Just because your tiny brain is incapable of comprehending The Senates brilliant machinations does not mean it is bad writing.

2017/07/26 - 15:22:06 New comment by: incognitobanjo


Obi-Wan doesn't need to be on the high ground, the high ground just needs to exist within the battle; Obi-Wan knows that when he has the low ground, he really has the high ground, from a certain point of view. 

Look at his battle record:

Maul: Has low ground, wins

Dooku: No high ground, loses

Dooku rematch: No high ground, loses 

Greivous: Has low ground, wins

Vader: Has high ground, wins

Vader rematch: No high ground, loses

Obi-Wan with the high/low ground is canonically the most powerful Jedi. This is fact. Had Yoda not denied his request to battle The Senate with typical Jedi arrogance, Obi-Wan could have defeated Palpatine in the Senate building, which housed a variety of different altitudes; this was designed so that the Chancellor could always have the moral high ground in political debates. But Obi-wan didn't fight The Senate, and Yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the Sheev in a normal 1v1.

Yoda is shorter than virtually every other fighter, which gives him a permanent low-ground disadvantage; however, his saber-fighting style utilizes a flipping-heavy technique in order to negate this weakness for a temporary window. You'll notice that, as he falls from the central podium in The Senate's building, he immediately retreats, knowing that he can never hold the high ground in this duel. You'll also notice that, while training Luke, he rides on him like a mount, to gain the intellectual high ground and accelerate Luke's training . Obi-Wan's defensive Form III lightsaber style synergizes with his careful military maneuvers; as he only strikes when prepared, he can always hold the strategic high ground. You'll come to realize that Commander Cody's artillery strike failed against Obi-Wan, when hundreds of Jedi were killed in similar attacks. Cody failed to grasp the strategic situation, as the Jedi Master's elevation was superior to his by hundreds of meters, making him virtually unkillable. Had Cody taken his time and engaged the Jedi on even terrain, he could have possibly succeeded. Obi-Wan then retreated under the surface of the lake, so that he could maintain the topographical low/high ground. In RotS, you'll notice that all the Jedi killed were on level ground with the clones, thereby assuring their demise.

As we all know, spinning is a good trick. However, only the Chosen one can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost due to this technique (but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived). The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach to combat (based in Eastern philosophy on balance), giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. Only the Chosen One can master the spin, as it is their destiny to maintain balance in the universe. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin fell to the dark side and could no longer use his signature trick, becoming the very thing he swore to destroy.

Anakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; all Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground on multiple vectors, so your perspective must be from a certain three-dimensional point of view in order to comprehend who holds the high ground. This is the only reason why Obi-Wan killed Maul in Rebels. This is also why Obi-Wan hates flying; there is no gravity in space, therefore there is no high or low ground from any frame of reference (This also negates the spinning trick).

It took the Tusken Raiders years of conflict against Old Ben Kenobi to grasp his superiority in terrain advantage, as you see them visibly flee in ANH when they realize he holds the low (inverse-high) ground. Additionally, Obi-Wan's victory in the cantina against the drunkard was assured, as he held the temperamental high ground, his actions more calculated and well-thought than the alcoholic, who was so uncivilized.

In ANH, Vader proves his newfound mastery by engaging Obi on perfectly even ground. However, Obi-Wan intentionally sacrifices himself on the Death Star, so that he could train Luke from a higher plane of existence, thereby giving him the metaphysical high ground.

Why was Vader so invested in the construction and maintenance of the Death Star? Because he knows Obi-wan can't have the high ground if there's no ground left. Image A.

As seen through the events of the Clone Wars, Obi-Wan was known to be on friendly terms with Senator Organa, whose homeworld held large quantities of mountainous terrain, the perfect habitat for a Jedi Master. Grand Moff Tarkin was already in position to destroy Alderaan as a first target, as the distance from Scarif to Alderaan was too vast to reach between the escape and recapture of the Tantive IV, even at 1.0 lightspeed. Alderaan had been the initial target all along, as Obi-Wan with the high ground was the primary threat to the Death Star. How? Because a moon-sized space station would have some form of gravitational pull, thereby negating Obi-Wan's zero-gravity weakness; Obi-Wan with the perpetual high-ground in a low-orbit starfighter would easily be able to fire proton torpedoes through a ventilation shaft, although the Empire was uncertain of the specific weakness of the Death Star planned by Galen Erso (who was a good friend).

In Return of the Jedi, you can see that the Throne Room contains a variety of different altitudes; Palpatine placed these there to ensure Vader's defeat. However, Sheev failed to realize that his weakness was no ground, and should have covered that useless gaping pit which does nothing.

In conclusion, Obi-wan abuses spatial relativity and Taoist doctrine in order to always invoke his high-ground powers.

Several open access journals have accepted a paper that details the role of Mitochondria (often referred to as Midichloria) in the purported use of The Force.

[See here for the full story.](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2017/07/22/predatory-journals-star-wars-sting/#.WXOF0Z8pBnE) The primary purpose here is to call attention to predatory publishing, where journals will charge authors to get their papers published. Authors need to get published, so this sounds like a good idea. However, some journals charge the researcher and promise - but never perform - peer review. It's hard for young researchers to know of this dark power, but it exists in the universe.

2017/07/26 - 17:06:32 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

Watch out for that vicious bounty hunter Boba Fett, Luke. Did I ever tell you about his father? He was hired to assassinate a senator that me and your father were guarding. 

We kept bringing her around open windows and public areas in order to draw her would be assassin out, but his cunning surprised even us. 

He had used his payment to hire another bounty hunter to kill the senator for him while he sent us on a wild bantha chase. And then that 2nd assassin used her payment to buy a robot to assassinate the senator for her. 

Did I mention the 2nd assassin was a shapeshifter? She could have been a good friend in disguise for all we knew! Where was I? 

Oh yes, then that robot used its payment to buy poisonous bugs to release into the senator's room while she slept, after lasering a hole through the window. It could have just lasered her because we we weren't watching her at all, but it as not a good shot. 

So we sense the hostile life forms in the room and rush in and save the senator in the nick of time! Then I jumped out the window to chase the robot back to its owner! Luckily it didn't have a self-destruct function. 

Then we found the 2nd assassin and chased her across the planet, and caught her when she tried to kill us instead of shapeshifting and escaping. But to our surprise, Jango Fett was watching the whole thing instead of going to kill the senator while we were away chasing the bugs chasing the robot chasing the shapeshifter. 

He shot her with a poisonous dart instead of sniper blaster, and only her instead of shooting all of us or blowing all of us with a rocket or something, then he escaped with his dumb jetpack. Mace Window killed him later, right in front of Boba. Mace was a good friend. Boba is a bad friend.

To be fair, the entire plot of the Prequels' is Palpatine's power play, and the convoluted nature of the assassination attempt supports this.

See, see, having it so that Obi-Wan and Anakin take down the decoy, the false assassin sets up the entire Clone Wars. Jango leaves no witnesses, kills them with a weapon that clearly links him with the murder. Kenobi tracks him down, leading him to the Clone Army. 

And the rest, is history. 

Padme was never meant to die. She was deliberately set up to look like a potential target as a means to an end.

It's only stupid when people use it as some sort of objective measure of a movie's worth. It makes sense as a tool to decide what to see for a general audience that isn't huge into movies but wants to catch something on their day off. 

But making a list akin to the AFI top 100 or Sight and Sound's lists of the 1,000 greatest films based on RT's percentage? Nah, it would probably produce a list more generic and fanboy infested than the IMDB top 250 if you went only by its ratings.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Planet Pluto "the dwarf"? I thought not. It's not a story the Astronomers would tell you. It's a Solar legend. Planet Pluto was a Terrestrial Planet of the Solar system, so powerful and so wise he could use the Gravity to influence the Astronomers to classify Planets... He had such a knowledge of the Outer Rim that he could even keep the rocks he cared about from being declassified.. The Outer Rim of the Galaxy is a pathway to many observations some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his status, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his Astronomers everything he knew, then his Astronomers declassified him in his orbit. Ironic, he could save others from becoming a dwarf, but not himself.

2017/07/26 - 23:47:46 New comment by: wsh009
I'm not so sure that it was necessarily designed to fail. Ultimately, Palpatine did plan to turn Anakin to the dark side, with or without Padme. You can see this in the Clone Wars, but Palpatine's primary goal was to unite the Republic against a common enemy and consolidate power.

> the entire plot of the Prequels' is Palpatine's power play

Is it? I feel like this stuff is more a symptom of the writing than the intent.

I'm pretty sure the entire plot of the Prequels was just Anakin's fall to the dark side and nothing else mattered much.

I'll agree that is not very Sith-like, but Vader was also just a tool for Palpatine; that is to say that he didn't save him for Vader's sake, but to use him as an asset.

When he was older he ended up preying on women, because of this cycle.

It’s a Sony legend. Darth Parkereuis was a Dark Lord of the Symbiote, so powerful and so wise he could use the symbitoe to influence his dance moves and create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark suit that he could even keep audience from caring. The dark side of the Symbiote is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was fixing his damn door, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, his landlord taught him everything he knew, then his land lord fixed the damn door in his sleep. Ironic. He could pay the rent for Aunt May, but not himself.

The whole scene is a mirror of the revenge of the sith scene. Obi wan is surrounded by droids about to be killed, grevious halts them, jumps from above and says "hello there". Then orders the robots to watch as they fight. In my mind it made grevious actions in episode 3 make sense, as it was a parallel of a previous meeting.

You have to consider the type of people that Padme was around. Always courtiers and suitors. And then there was Annie, unsullied, without a mother figure whom he would cling to after they took him away. Someone who would never leave her, always loyal. 

Until the Jedi took him. His loyalty divided, her loyalty spoken for by a system she had no say in (elected Queen at 14? Never a chance to date without a planets balance hanging in the end). She needed an outlet, someone who understood how maddening it was that destiny forced them along a path they did not choose.

So since Obi-wan was single...

With Rebels, the contrast is even more jarring. Ezra mind controlling a AT-ST pilot to shoot at troops yelling at the pilot to stop, and then the AT-ST just falling off a cliff to his death.

I'm gonna be quite honest, this actually was a scene I hoped they kept. Sure it was mostly just to show Greedo, but at least showing a more aggressive and angry side to young Anakin would have worked a lot better in the long run, instead of how they showed an aggressive and angsty side out of nowhere in Episode 2.

If this image isn't from the OT then I don't know where it's from. I could just be remembering wrong though

Having binge watched the series, it definitely was more kid oriented early on. It wasn't until towards the end of season 2 and onwards where it started to tackle some more complex and interesting subjects with the episodes.

2017/07/27 - 05:43:40 New comment by: Ajaxlancer
I suppose that depends on why Jango went to shoot her in the first place. If he was going to kill her anyway, Obi probably still could have seen him, and he (Jango) wouldn't know if she was dead so he would go anyway.

If she called him for backup or something earlier on it could be different.

Don't remember if its TCW or Rebels, but they do elaborate why Qui Gon doesn't have a force manifestation/ghost and thus why he didn't disappear on his death. 

No spoilers, but basically his strong connection to the force allowed him to come back and guide Yoda/Obi where as they were straight up trained to be "one" with the force, disappear, and get a ghost.

Anakin getting one though...yeah that's just typical Lucas fuckery.

I agree with you about ahsoka being like that in the first 2 seasons but keep in mind she was 14. In canon I like to think she was the typical impatient teen, although the most obvious answer is the writers not possibly knowing where to take her character

There was one line somewhere in season 1 that made me roll my eyes out of their sockets. They try to get away with saying that they haven't killed anyone.

Like sure even for the sake of argument let's say that NONE of those stormtroopers died from any of those blaster shots. But what about the several TIE fighters they shot down that crashed with big explosions!? Surely you're not trying to say THOSE guys lived.

I've developed a theory that the empire does not consider TIE pilots real people with rights.

Then you escape and spend the next 20 years looking for the geezer he cut off your legs with only your hate carrying you until you find him in the desert, try to kill him, strike blades twice, try to distract and kill him like how you killed his master only to have your lightsaber sliced in two and your fucking chest sliced open and die in the arms of the guy you dedicated the last three decades of your life to hating and attempting to torture and kill,

Yeah, but child soldiers are commonplace in Star Wars. It's almost like maturity and such just doesn't count for anything to them. You got the Jedi padawans taken from their parents to help lead the Grand Army of the Republic. Then there's the Grand Army of the Republic that's made up entirely of young clones who were bread only for war. Then there are the rebels who fight against the Empire in the Galactic Civil War, including minors like Ezra Bridger or Sabine Wren. Then there's the First Order that steals children like the Jedi of old. Not to mention the droids used by everyone, who like the Republic's clones, are intelligent individuals engineered just for war. 

What I don't get is how this isn't pointed out more often.

Based off the biology of Togruta seen in older Ahsoka and Shaak Ti, I believe that the sign of a Togruta reaching adulthood/going through puberty is signalled by the growth of their head tails. Ahsoka's are short in the clone wars as she is only 14-16, while in Rebels they are fully grown. If anything, Togruta's would have a delayed maturity

I would say prequel era is everything before A New Hope. Under the same logic, sequel era is everything after Return of the Jedi. There's not much there, but we do have a little, the Aftermath and Bloodline books, Lost Stars starts in OT and goes beyond into sequel era, I think Battlefront II takes place after Episode VI, and The Force Awakens, of course. There are also a bunch of Force Awakens tie-ins, junior novels, the film novelization, and we recently got a short cartoon starring Rey. There's also a few comics, one called Shattered Empire and I think there's a bunch of issues starring Poe Dameron too.

I remember in the first airing of Rookies, the clones come out of a vent and a flying monster scares them which prompts one of the clones to go "What the hell was that?!" The following week when they replayed the episode before the new one, the line was cut to "What was that?!" I thought it was interesting and wondered what made them censor it. It's the original line on Netflix IIRC.

I know that part of the point of memes is to exaggerate a scene in order to make it funnier, but suggesting that Padmé ever hit on 9-year-old Anakin in TPM is ridiculous. At most you could say that Anakin had a precocious crush on her without being old enough to realize what that even meant, but you can't call Padmé's maternal/big-sisterly protectiveness in TPM romantic. Memes should be funny and over-the-top, but not inaccurate. 

(Alternatively: OP can't do that! Shoot him/her... or something!)

Depends on the TCW season. Personally first two TCW seasons were targeted at a too young audience for my taste. 
But the longer it ran the darker it got (that episodes on umbara...damn)
Rebels isn't quite as dark as the last TCW seasons but apart from a super-annoying Ezra it's not too bad. Also the storyline and references are much more coherent (how does whiny-attack-of-the-clones-Anakin become such a souvereign, chill Jedi in TCW but instantly revert back to being a sissy in EpIII? Dooku is portrayed as being a cold hearted killer who gasps for power; the whole Ahsoka plot, as much as I like it, doesn't really fit Anakin's rise and fall within  a the order and a few other things don't really fit together)

What most people overlook when comparing Rebels & TCW is that those are different genres. Yes, both are animated Star wars series and last 20min/episode.
But while Rebels is a classic action/comedy movie setup with a bunch of troubled but special outsiders united by a common enemy, stumbling from adventure to adventure and setting aside personal differences and becoming a family in the progress; TCW is more like a war chronicle. Sure there's the storyline of Ahsoka but that's really the only one connecting the various battlegrounds. The main focus is on the Clone Wars themselves and how the whole galaxy progressed through this difficult time, there's a lot of politics and episodes rather than developing character relationships

There is also a major difference between the referencing system between the two. Rebels uses mostly internal references from the 'legends' and EU, creating a web of the whole Star wars universe. TCW on the other hand copies shamelessly from just every major military conflict in the 20th century. Panama, Vietnam, Cuba, France, Somalia they are all refitted into the context of the Star Wars universe (and therefore the stories feel more real sometimes as they kinda were..)

It starts with S4E11 "Kidnapped" where a colony of Togruta are taken by slavers, then the next 2 episodes are about the attempts by Anakin, Ahsoka, Obi Wan and Rex to rescue the slaves from the slaver's capital. The implication of sex slavery comes from Anakin telling the queen that he took Ahsoka, in disguise as a slave, from another slaver's home and that we've seen in other episodes that Togruta are also used as exotic dancers in pirate dens

2017/07/27 - 12:00:56 New comment by: Comander-07
which is exactly the reason why TWC is so damn good. We see more about the universe, more about the characters, interesting story lines but most important we have episodes dedicated to the clones and their different personalitys. 
some episodes where indeed pure garbage (like thr 3 kamino episides) and dooku is portrayed to dark to fast. But everything is *great*.
TWC is in my opinion the most interesting part of the  visualized franchise. Also it was not as over the top as the 2003 version (which was a good watch, but considering the numbers of the clones the 2003 version was just unbelievable)
The biggest negative of the 2008 TWC was the splitting of plots over multiple seasons. Like the Ventress thing took a year long break before continuing or the Zabraks where stretched over 3 seasons.
But even the first 2 seasons where a good watch. Nothing too fancy, but the right thing to watch with friends. (like I still do sometimes)

2017/07/27 - 12:16:49 New comment by: GallantGentleman
I totally agree (however I liked the Kamino episode, not for the plot but...you know...Kamino. awesome place. And Shaak Ti. Probably would have chosen her over Anakin as Ahsoka's master and hence co star of the series but well..)

However we both are on a sub called prequelmemes so safe to say we both more or less enjoy the prequels and I'm 99% certain anyone who's enjoying the prequels isn't enjoying them for the deep realistic love story between anakin and padme... Following a wider range of connections and layers of the whole galaxy, exploring the clone armies, political developments, the backgrounds of the war and so on is naturally appealing to our taste.

But there are people out there - misguided people - who genuinely dislike these parts, who say TFA was the best Star Wars movie since the OT and who's favorite character is Luke. Rebels is more appealing to them naturally. Also the story of a kid/teen becoming the troubled hero appeals to a puberty audience. Disney is milking the franchise, but tbf at least they put some good effort in it. The returned Ahsoka is pretty awesome imo, Thrawn was really good adapted for the series and the way they incorporate little things like references to Kyle Katarn and other things shows some effort and that the creators actually know their stuff (something I missed in TFA. Did JJ Abrams actually watched any of the Star Wars movies/series/books except for a new hope?)

I don't think you can say anyone is misguided, everyone has their own personal tastes. The prequels were my first exposure to Star Wars, I'll always remember them like the back of my hand, but the Original Trilogy and the sequels are much more entertaining for me to actually watch.

If I was to start someone off with the series, it would without a doubt be A New Hope, the Phantom Menace or any of the other prequels are far too boring, silly or in Rogue One's case, not entirely relevant. But that's just me.

oh I mixed Kamino with mon cala. The 3 episodes in the water with the whiny prince and sharkhead CIS general.

I always believed most people make fun about the prequels because they hate it. Would be interesting to see how many here actually like them.

Yes I know people who think TFA was "good" or "great" and I most likely poison their drinks when ever they say this. I cant tolerate Disney since they mess with the story and canceled Star Wars 1313 (the game)
I really liked rogue one though. (maybe because I knew everyone would die from the start, probably because Darth Vader never looked more badass in the movies)

Shouldnt the troubled teen story be more the prequel thing? Luke was already 20ish at the start of ep 4
(and yes I dislike Luke in the movies. I could tolerate him in some books but he *looked into the lightsaber* ffs he is on par with kylo. Atleast kylo wears black)

I actually dont consider any Star Wars movie great. Not a single one. They are overall good, but the franchise and backstorys are just so much more epic. I dont even remember what my first SW movie was, but I never feared Vader or anything like this. So starting people with the OT would be my choice as well. But I tend to say they where are boring. Plot armoured MCs, totally unable enemies. An emperor which only appears after the first movie to get a bigger villain than vader. Unbelievably bad Lightsaber duels. They are only good if you like the franchise. And since I do I like to watch them. But the OT story was just not good. For me it only became good because of all the stuff which happens before. 
(the movies are rebel propaganda so I have to dislike them)

It became popular because its an adaptation on classic tales told through millennia with a twist and good effects. It was never popular because it was just good, and it had this huge expansion, it didn't, it forged its own path. And it still does, 90% of the people who watch Star Wars have never read a book on it, and never will. That's your own appeal to it, but a very niche one at that.

That was a joke, though it'd be obvious.

While the OT & RO are of course the best ones to get into Star Wars I like the additional discourses of the prequels. 
The OT has a pretty narrow look on things, the empire is pure evil while the rebels are always good and their actions are never really questioned, while they are effectively terrorists who tolerate an immense amount of casualties to reach their goals. Prequels are different. You see the ineffectiveness of the Galactic Senate, a corrupt system, lots of lobbys meddling into affairs and a group of planets who want to change things but ultimately end up causing a civil war (last but not least due to a sith lord betraying them from the start to serve his own agenda). Personally I like that. You need the foundation to be able to appreciate it, but just because it's more complex I wouldn't prefer the 'easier' OT movies.

which is also the reason why I watch the animated series and not just the overhyped new movies because "everyone does". The hype around TFA you would be considered an outsider if you did not watch it. Media has its marketing role truly fulfilled.
Most people today also did not watch ep4 first because they grew up with the prequels. So they would consider them natural and the OT beeing weird sequels. But Star Wars has such a big fanbase that the overwhelming opinion "hurr durr prequels are bad" affects newcomers heavily.
In my opinion there is a difference betweem liking a franchise anf beeing a fan. Namely reading more about the lore then the movies offer.
And I wont be satisfied with Star Wars till we either get a Darth Bane movie trilogy (which fallows the book.. looking at you disney) or a cinematical KOTOR trilogy

Yeah Padme's pacifism is really annoying. I'm in season 2, and she has yet to make a solid argument for why they should stop producing clones and fighting. It's just "because fighting and killing are bad and we need to talk things through." And she says that until someone is pointing a gun in her face, at which point she either has to use a gun herself or her Jedi lover has to impale someone.

 I also recall the blue shadow virus episodes where she went ahead and did stupid character things, like going into a droid occupied lab knowing of the virus by herself. It's a wonder she got infected..

Clone Wars had several seasons with several story lines and the only theme "the clone wars" whilst the movies were about Anakin and had to tell all this whilst showing the chosen one plot within 6h. It's not a fair match. 

Also from talking with colleagues, friends, family members, you and I aren't really a majority. Most people dislike all the politics in the prequels for some reason.

But I don't think the politics was poorly executed in the movies. That was actually quite alright. They could have cut the Lovestory and Anakin complaining all the time to a bare minimum instead and developed the politics and Dooku a bit further. I found the theory interesting that Dooku after turning the back on the Jedi order and thus losing credibility with them didn't work with but at some point against Sidious and by leading the CIS was actually a political idealist trying to save at least part of the Galaxy from the Sith. Would've been an intriguing side plot and more worthwhile to watch than Hayden Christensen's "acting" on Naboo. But I reckon some plots sell better with the majority than others.

2017/07/27 - 14:11:40 New comment by: HemperorPalpatine
Real plot analysis: Dooku (not Frank) hired the assassins to kill Padme in order to convince Nute Gunray to join the Seperatists. That much is spelled out in the film. There is no reason to believe this assassination plays any other role in Frank's plot. 

It's perfectly reasonable that Jango would work with a partner. Maybe Zam was his apprentice. Maybe Jango felt that this was a high risk job and didn't want to be implicated in the assassination if something went wrong. Yes it's a bit contrived to set up the Obi Wan detective storyline, but you see this kind of thing in movies all the time.

Under normal circumstances they would never have got past her security with a guns blazing approach. Hence the stealth assassination with poison bugs. Anakin was using her as bait--as stated in the film--which is why she was unguarded, which the assassins did not anticipate.

It's not bad writing and it doesn't require a convoluted explanation.

By the way--Jango using the Kamino saber dart also makes sense. Hit her anywhere on her body and she's dead in one shot. Miss a vital organ with the laser, and she talks. The saber dart could not be traced, even by top analysis droids. Good thing Obi-Wan knew Dex.

Lets ask another question - how can you tell the difference between good writing and bad writing? Why people call complex, interesting story with original and dark ending, that even 10 years later still has some mysteries "bad writing", and why they call simple, cliche storyline good guys vs bad guys "good writing"? Why simple, casual line "I dont like sand" is a symbol of bad dialogues, but no one gives a shit about these abominations - "you are only a master of evil, Darth", "i recognized your foul stench when i was brought on board", "Why, you stuck up, half-witted, scruffy-looking Nerfherder!" and many others? Why Shakespearean style is a bad thing? Why people hate on Jar Jar and his humor, but then adore stupid american humor in TFA, when they are equally stupid? Why people hate Episode 1 for "being boring", but call Episode 5 the best, when it consists of 50% Luke training on Dagobah and 50% Han and Leia running from Empire? Why people hate CGI in prequels (which was the best for its time), but praise those ugly puppets and fake miniatures in OT? Why people bash prequels for everything, but ignore similar problems in OT and ST? I honestly cant understand it. Maybe because I am not american, or maybe because I dont have giant nostalgia glasses.

I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

Yup. And there were several stories they had to cut to make that work. Disney cancelled it so they had full control over the canon.

TCW is great. I see your point on the first two seasons. However, there were some more adult isa episodes in the first two seasons. "Rookies", the Genesis episodes, "lair of Grievous" and even the Malavolence episodes were pretty dark.

I agree it's annoying. But you just answered your own problem lol. She thinks fighting and killing are not justified ever. That's why she's a pacifist. I mean, if worked for Gandhi. Also, the Jedi would still be alive if they gave into the separatists demands and allowed whatever systems wanted to leave the republic to leave. That would literally ruin Sheev's entire plan.

rogue one might be my favorite SW movie, solely for the Vader scenes in it. 
TFA was utter garbage, turned me nearly into a sith lord over my hatred and anger for Disney 
The prequels version I saw was really really good. While EP2 was still cringy on naboo and Jar Jar still not the greatest character ever, since I never saw the original english dub I couldnt understand all the hate for it. I will probably watch it in english soon, but think this subreddit shows the shitstorm towards the prequels. Here even 1 single word became a meme. And then the biggest critical point is dialogue. I mean they want to hate it. It never stood a chance for original fans.

I'm not sure if they would still be alive, considering their leaders were Sith lords and a cyborg hell bent on destroying the Jedi. The idea of independence from the republic was a farce, and their true motives were the destruction of the republic and the Jedi. Of course, Padme had no way of knowing that.

Had the worms successfully attached to padme, they would have secretly lain eggs in her mouth a la Alien. This organism, nicknamed the PalmBurster, would hatch from her hand in about 3 weeks, and due to fears of an epidemic padme would be moved to quarantine. When she was in quarantine, The Senate would track the Palmburster which would rapidly mature into a Hanomorph and the Senate would train it. In about 5 weeks after padme enters quarantine, Zam Wessel would gas her chamber. This sleep gas would cause her to faint attracting the guards. This is where it gets complex. These guards would enter her chamber..... only for the Hanomorph to shut the door behind them. The guards would panic and shoot at the door, however the Senate would have had someone coat the door with a reflective paint, bouncing the shots back at padme. They would miss, but the guards would appear in court for attempted murder. 

Whilst padme is on the witness stand, a bounty hunter hired by the Hanomorph enters and attempts to shoot the lawyer questioning padme, making her seem suspicious. She is then arrested. In galactic jail, they have a captured bounty hunter place poison in her food, making her appear dead. The funeral takes place on naboo, and padme (still comatose) is placed in the tomb. When Anakin and Obi wan come to visit a small droid administers the antidote and Padme wakes up. Believing she is a zombie, Anakin and Obi-Wan kill her. When Anakin realises what happened he is heart broken and falls to the dark side.

All this planning was ruined when Anakin and Obiwan killed the worms

>Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute.
Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo.
>While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict....

Outlying star systems been taxing Trade Fed like crazy. Little robber barons out there. And the blockade *works*. It leads to negotiations!

Supposing you were an evil mastermind for a moment. You've executed a plan to lead someone along to discover an army which you wish for them to use to proliferate conflict in the world.

Then, instead of noticing the breadcrumbs you've left, the dolt doesn't pick up on the clue, and just goes back to his normal life & whatnot. He didn't pick up on what you were putting down, but he also didn't catch onto any wind of a plot.

So, do you just call it a day & forget the army ever existed? Or do you throw some more breadcrumbs around until the dunce of a Jedi bites?

Thinking that fighting, killing, and mass producing sentient humans are bad IS a reason though... that's kind of what pacifist ideology revolves around. I think there's an ep in season 3 that implies most of the separatist systems themselves are willing to have peace talks (if not for sith meddling), so it's not as if her pacifism was pointless.

I know it may be treason, but I think this as well about Setine and the Mandalore arc in season 5. She has armed thugs raging through her city, an angry populace, no army, an incompetent police force, and cries out to the Republic for help who she has repeatedly turned down the opportunity to align with. Her response: "we must remain peaceful or we give up all of our cultural progress".

I don't think having an emotional response to your wife kissing and groping someone else is inappropriate. Especially when that wife ups the ante because she is pissed. At one point they fight and call for splitting up which put him under more stress I'd imagine.

That I have to revolt

2017/07/27 - 18:46:49 New comment by: you_got_fragged
Obi-Wan doesn't need to be on the high ground, the high ground just needs to exist in the battle; Obi-Wan knows that when he has the low ground, he really has the high ground, from a certain point of view. Look at his battle record:
Maul: Has low ground, wins
Dooku: No high ground, loses
Greivous: Has low ground, wins
Vader: Has high ground, wins
Vader rematch: No high ground, loses
Obi-Wan with the high/low ground is canonically the most powerful Jedi. This is fact. Had Yoda not denied his request with typical Jedi arrogance, he could have beat Palpatine in the Senate building, which housed a variety of different altitudes; this so that the Chancellor could always have the moral high ground in Senate debates. But Obi-wan didn't fight Palpatine, and Yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the Sheev in a normal 1v1.
As we all know, spinning is a good trick. However, only the Chosen one can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost (but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived). The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach (based in Eastern philosophy on balance), giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin failed to maintain balance in the universe, symbolic of his fall to the dark side.
Anakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; all Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground. This is the only reason why ______ killed ______ in Rebels. This is also why Obi-Wan hates flying; in space, there is no high ground as there is no frame of reference from which there is a high or low ground, due to the lack of gravity.
In ANH, Vader proves his newfound mastery by engaging Obi on perfectly even ground. However, he lets himself die on the Death Star so that he could train Luke from a higher plane of existence.
(Why was Vader so invested in the construction and maintenance of the Death Star? Because he knows Obi-wan can't have the high ground if there's no ground left.)
In Return of the Jedi, you can see that the Throne Room contains a variety of different altitudes; Palpatine placed these there to ensure Vader's defeat. However, Sheev failed to realize that his weakness was no ground, and should have covered that gaping pit that does nothing.
In conclusion, Obi-wan abuses spatial relativity and Buddhist doctrine in order to invoke his high-ground powers.

If I'm not mistaken, Lucas originally pitched it as a PG-13 Star Wars show. It wasn't supposed to be specifically a kids show, even if a lot of early episodes were kid friendly.

2017/07/27 - 19:56:48 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

because "bad writing" as an insult is, itself, bad writing. It's not creative or persuasive to just say that something was written poorly. It's a lazy insult. 

It's dismissive in such a way that your argument is dismissed. If you don't care enough to make a coherent criticism, and instead chalk it up to bad writing, then why should I care to listen to what you have to say? Being dismissive in general is not a good way to persuade someone. All it shows is that you don't care enough to educate yourself, to be equipped to make a proper opinion.

In short, "bad writing" is a baseless rookie criticism, employed by people who have probably only taken an introductory level writing course.

Yep if you go to the Star Wars .com you can see some of these episodes imagine a 1988 metal gear solid game level graphics with even worse animations nothing like the rest of the show because it was unfinished however they already had the voice acting done pretty well in the one episode I watched they actually were going to make it cannon that echo didn't actually die and survived however Disney cancelled it so RIP echo I still can't understand why they cancelled such a profitable and loved show

I assume you refer to Alderaan. They destroyed it because it was so infested with rebels, they couldn't do anything with it.

The Empire doesn't kill their own civilians. What would even be the point of that? Just being evil?! They stop at nothing to eliminate the rebel threat, that's true.

I'm not saying the Empire are the good guys. I'm just saying the rebels aren't that much better (even if they are slightly better, they are still not good guys). Just because we watch the movies from the rebels' A-team's POV.

Harsh truth, Disney only understands money. If we show them we want this or CW return and not a new season of rebels, show them with ratings. Don't watch their shows they pump out, don't buy their merch. Demand the content we deserve, hit them where it hurts, amigos: their wallets. Spread word and it can make a difference

A) Rebels is prequel territory.

B) Making one show unpopular enough to kill off would probably result in Disney pulling the plug on *any* Star Wars show.

Yeah... to be honest, I grew up with the Prequels, which weren't much in the way of making you a fan of a series (well, BEFORE the memes, of course). It was KOTOR that made me a Star Wars fan.

Nuh-uh. Jedi didn't steal, they asked. FO doesn't seem like the kind of people that would ask, and if they did I'd love to hear their argument.

TWC Was not canceled because they wanted to air Rebels. Rebels came around quite a bit after Disney took over and TWC was canceled.

From what I've read. CN owned some of the rights to TCW as it aired on it. So why would CN allow Disney, one of its largest competitors, to Air a show that was much of their revenue at the time. Disney simply could not continue making TWC for legal reason. Not because they hated the prequel era or whatever dumb crap people say.

Well they could have partnered with Cartoon Network for the sake of the show's fans.  And as far as money goes, they both would have made a huge profit from those final seasons.  Disney just bough the rights to Lucasfilm.  So in the end, the only reason I see that it was canceled is that Disney wanted the property all to themselves despite the massive profits the show would have gotten them

Half of the material made for Star Wars outside of the films isn't meant for kids. Even the prequels aren't really for kids. Half of the reason they suck is because he kept jamming in kid friendly shit when it just didn't fit in a story of politics and what is essentially religion.

It's because the Old Republic is basically the Lord of the Rings era of Star Wars. Everything is far more mystical. I'm also one of the few who only started giving a shit until I saw the Old Republic. I loved the franchise before, but it was because I kept thinking about what else they can do and I would get myself excited. Then I found out all my dreams were actually fully realized in the Old Republic and that got me way more excited. Partially why I was pissed that it's no longer canon. It's the reason I became a true fan in the first place.

2017/07/28 - 03:50:18 New comment by: health__insurance
Speaking of, is there a consensus on the moral implications of Obiwan leaving a very much alive and helpless quadruple amputeed Anakin to burn alive? He should have carried Anakin out to face trial or whatever. Instead he leaves him to slowly sink into the lava and a horribly agonizing slow death, and ironically creating the worst villain the galaxy has ever seen. 

Obiwan's failure to take Anakin back was a horribly cruel and evil action.

I figure if the OT seems more like it's for kids than it's probably how the main character is written. That's just my take, but people disagree on this subject all the time and it has to do with how they were raised.

Remember Batman: The Animated Series? That series was originally intended for kids, but ended up as a show parents could stand to watch with their kids, and that these kids could still enjoy when they grew older. The Clone Wars and Rebels are kind of like that. Then it becomes like one of those Anime series that were recommended for teenagers due to the level of violence and thematic character development. People die in this series. Characters change and grow in depth thoughout. Aspects of Star Wars that were neglected in the films are fully explored and fleshed out.

rl;dr: adults can enjoy CGI star wars cartoons (But to Hell with those Ewoks and Droids series')

I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Jedi academy, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids against the Separatist Alliance and the Sith, and I have over 300 confirmed victories in lightsaber duels. I am trained in all forms of lightsaber combat and I’m the most accomplished master among all Jedi in form III Soresu. You are nothing to me but just another battle droid. I will cut one of your limbs the fuck off with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in this Galaxy, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of probe droids across the Galactic Republic and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with the force. Not only am I extensively trained in the force and lightsaber combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Grand Army of the Republic and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the Galaxy, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” meme was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking fingers. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

I mean, even in the original trilogy two characters get their arms chopped off and the camera cuts to a bloody arm on the floor. I don't see how anyone making a movie with a story like Star Wars sits back and goes "yep, this is a kids movie". Sure, kids can watch it (even then half the stuff in RotS is too scary for a lot of kids), but it's not a movie made for kids; I wonder if he even realizes the difference.

I disagree. Rogue One was OK, but nothing too outstanding. Compared to the last four Star Wars movies it was a masterpiece, but as a movie it was fairly mediocre and had more than a few problems.

I didn't say rebels killed civilians. I said the Empire didn't kill civilians either (except for Alderaan). They only punished rebels and rebel collaborants. What would be the point of slaughtering your own loyal civilians? They didn't tolerate supporting the rebels, that's true.

You are trying to make the Empire evil. Palpatine was evil. Darth Vader was evil. The Empire itself wasn't

that's a weird distinction to make. The Empire(under the guidance of Palpy) went out hunting and slaughtering force sensitive children. They killed civilians in testing the death star (Rogue One). They aren't killing just to kill, but they have zero care about collateral damage when it comes to maintaining power. 

The rebels kill too, but they do care about collateral damage. They won't kill civilians just to further their goals. 

It comes down to: is it okay to kill to prevent more death? Which is pretty complex morally

2017/07/28 - 11:24:00 New comment by: Agent_Kozak
bi-Wan doesn't need to be on the high ground, the high ground just needs to exist in the battle; Obi-Wan knows that when he has the low ground, he really has the high ground, from a certain point of view. Look at his battle record:
Maul: Has low ground, wins
Dooku: No high ground, loses
Greivous: Has low ground, wins
Vader: Has high ground, wins
Vader rematch: No high ground, loses
Obi-Wan with the high/low ground is canonically the most powerful Jedi. This is fact. Had Yoda not denied his request with typical Jedi arrogance, he could have beat Palpatine in the Senate building, which housed a variety of different altitudes; this so that the Chancellor could always have the moral high ground in Senate debates. But Obi-wan didn't fight Palpatine, and Yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the Sheev in a normal 1v1.
As we all know, spinning is a good trick. However, only the Chosen one can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost (but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived). The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach (based in Eastern philosophy on balance), giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin failed to maintain balance in the universe, symbolic of his fall to the dark side.
Anakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; all Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground. This is the only reason why ______ killed ______ in Rebels. This is also why Obi-Wan hates flying; in space, there is no high ground as there is no frame of reference from which there is a high or low ground, due to the lack of gravity.
In ANH, Vader proves his newfound mastery by engaging Obi on perfectly even ground. However, he lets himself die on the Death Star so that he could train Luke from a higher plane of existence.
(Why was Vader so invested in the construction and maintenance of the Death Star? Because he knows Obi-wan can't have the high ground if there's no ground left.)
In Return of the Jedi, you can see that the Throne Room contains a variety of different altitudes; Palpatine placed these there to ensure Vader's defeat. However, Sheev failed to realize that his weakness was no ground, and should have covered that gaping pit that does nothing.
In conclusion, Obi-wan abuses spatial relativity and Buddhist doctrine in order to invoke his high-ground powers.

Indeed. They should have cast a really tall guy in Attack of the Clones. My problems with Hayden Christensen is not his performance, which I think he did they best he could with the material, but that Lucas *really* wanted Anakin to echo Luke as a "winy teenager looking young man" which I think was a gigantic mistake. 

He should have thought less about character archetypes and more about character. And then cast someone huge who could pass for young Vader/Anakin Skywalker. If I were making Attack of the Clones today I would look at Armie Hammer for instance (6'4.5/194cm).

> If anyone, George Lucas did. He lost all my respect when he recently said that Star Wars was for kids.

He said it is targeting the 12-13 year old demographic. They have Jawas, Ewoks, Ugnaughts, all manner of young kid-friendly shit in every film as well.

A child getting killed, an arm chopped off, a man burnt alive, a bit of blood and politics etc doesn't make Star Wars more adult. Marvel Films do similar stuff and they target the exact same audience.

There is not a single Star Wars film that doesn't target kids first and foremost.

2017/07/28 - 12:25:31 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

Ok, breaking the jerk here for a moment and being serious

Why? It was stupid. Why is the legitimate ruling government not putting down a violent insurrection? They have a right and obligation to do so, but they don't for the sake of rehashing the Episode IV rebel underdog storyline.

Rey is one of the worst Mary Sues since Superman. Literally no flaws, and stands toe to toe with a trained dark side user without cutting herself to ribbons immediately, reverses his own force tricks on him, knows the Falcon better than Han fucking Solo, all of this while having no formal training in any of that shit. Luke at least got some time with Obi Wan before feeling the force to guide a plasma bomb and was regarded as whiny and obnoxious, and didn't face off with Vader until working under Yoda for a while. 

Not to mention Finn suddenly gaining a conscience spontaneously despite being brainwashed from childhood as a storm trooper?

>fly a space ship despite never being in one

She flew the spaceship, just never off-world. Similar to Luke, in a new hope.

>or beating a sith lord

kylo wasn't a sith Lord. He hadn't completed his training. He was also seriously injured from the bowcaster shot to the gut.

>first try with 0 training. 

I think this might get fleshed out in the last Jedi, but I think that rey was not as green as we were led to believe. Kylo's reaction to rey escaping seems to hint at some prior knowledge about the girl.

Kylo ain't no sith lord, he a lil bitch, and he was hurt, did you ever get a bowcaster shot to the gut? Let's see you fight with a gaping wound, big man! He managed to beat Finn easily, a soldier trained from birth. It's clear Rey is equally (or even more) strong with the force, that's why she won (and cause she wasn't hurt and isn't a lil bitch). Y'all just look at the surface.

Im only a PT student so i could always be wrong but try rest, ice, compression and elevation for a few days and if it doesn't get any better you should definitely seek some medical attention. Did you hear/feel a pop when you were injured? Also you say your shoulder hurts when you move it in certain directions so is it just pain or do you also have reduced range of motion?

No reduced range of motion, just moderate pain(4/10) specifically when fully extended upward, and fully extended medially across the across the chest.

I'll take Episode 1 over TFA any day. I dont mind politics or Jar Jar, and I can watch Darth Maul vs Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon for a 1000 times, but I didnt find even one moment in TFA, that I would like to rewatch. That movie is only good, if you have heavy nostalgia for OT. And even then - if you are actual OT fan, you will quickly realize, how bland and unoriginal that movie is. If I would want to watch a New Hope - I will just go and watch a New Hope. I dont need black guys, Mary Sues and emo for that.

Mostly superficial, absolutely no pain in any muscle. Just that bone, and radiating slightly outward in all directions. I have a pretty low body fat percentage, so the bones are visible anyway, and I have no external bruising, no swelling, just hurts.

I think the Force Awakens is probably my least favorite Star Wars movie.  

It doesn't have the prequels cringe scenes, but it also doesn't have much of anything new.  
The story is mostly a New Hope rehash, the ships are uninteresting, and poorly lit, the environments mostly bland, and the "Star killer" base, the cringiest, most in joke name ever, is insanely lame, and hidious looking.  
(Also, how the hell does this stupid thing get built, when the empire at it's height of power could only build 2 Death Stars?!?).  
The damn film, when all is said and done, just doesn't feel like a Star Wars film, and especially doesn't **look** like one.  

If there was ever a movie I wanted remade, it's The Force Awakens. Keep most of the actors, the first half of the film, but scrap that fracking in joke plot hole from hell. Also, actually create some cool vehicles, and **LIGHT THEM PROPERLY!**  
Star Wars has always had excellent ambient lighting, then at the start of Ep7, you can't see didly on that new destroyer. Heck, even when they are escaping the ship, you fantastic see half the detail because of the motion blur, and poor lighting.

Not my point, the point is that deep down the prequels aren't kids films. I keep saying this but I'll say it again, they're about religion and betrayal. If George took the time to realize this instead of jamming in kid friendly stuff where it didn't belong, the films may not have been as bad as they are.

Have you ever heard the tragedy of Darth original content the wise? I thought not. It's not a story the reposters will tell you. It's an original legend. Darth original content was a dark lord of the sith, so powerful and wise that he could influence the midichlorians to create content... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could keep the reposters he knew about from reposting his posts. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course he did. Unfortunately he taught us apprentice everything he knew, and his apprentice reposted one of his posts in his sleep. Ironic.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth McCain the Maverick? 


I thought not. It's not a story the Democrats would tell you. It's a Republican legend. Darth McCain was a Dark Lord of the Republicans, so powerful and so wise he could use his vote to influence the entire Senate... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he almost made it to the White House with an incompetent apprentice. The dark side of the Senate is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was being "disturbed" enough with happenings in the Senate that he would actually have to act, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately for the Senate, he voted no on the very bill that would have damaged the American Healthcare System even further.  Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

>when the next movie comes out and there is no sub plot that rey was already a trained jedi with a memory wipe,  i wonder what new excuse you rey fanboys will come up with.

The memory wipe theory make about as much sense as any other theory suggested so far. The technique has occurred elsewhere in the star wars universe, and kylo has demonstrated he has an affinity for messing with others minds (the several mind torture scenes). I don't see how trying to fill in plot holes is considered being a rey fanboy. Force Awakens fanboy, maybe.


>also where did the movie ever claim she flew a ship before? wasn't there literal dialogue that stated the falcon was the first time she ever flew?

Well, she's a dirt-poor vagrant who can barely afford bread, so I imagine jaunting around in a spaceship is beyond her means. For the same reason I wouldn't assume that a vagrant that sleeps rough on the streets also knows how to pilot small aircraft.

Physio here. Can't give out advice per say but sounds like an ac joint sprain, as long as there is no obvious deformity most likely a grade I AC joint sprain. No anti inflams in the first 24 hours because they have been shown to disrupt inflammatory chemicals necessary to kickstart the healing process. Do not fret however alway wait 36 hours and do your RICER. Once the inflammation has settled down you will be able to assess what is wrong. Like I said there are many things that can go wrong in the shoulder however most of them usually don't occur.
Main point RICER 48-36 hrs then begin loading after one week gradually this is regardless of the injury

That was what I liked. It showed a different side to the Star Wars universe we hadn't seen before. Imo Rogue one solved one of SW's most well known plot holes (How did they have the Death Star plans) and added to the universe. Imo TFA didn't add to the universe and only added problems like why Rey is practically god, or how the first order is dreadfully similar to the Empire and frankly most of the film was a rehash of EPIV.

Not really sure how that matters. Either way it's out of the price range of your average destitute vagrant who can't buy a loaf of bread.

So where is it, then? As far as we can tell she has no possessions beyond her stick and her hovercraft

Yeah, but it's really hard to properly judge the first movie in the trilogy, like how (imo) jar jar was the phantom menace, and people reacted so negatively that it might've changed the series. I think a little trust in the trilogy movies goes a long way. It currently makes no sense, but it might later on and be genius.

I went to the beach and saw sand. I found it a little rough and coarse, but a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one, it was only very mildly irritating. But boy did it get everywhere!

I also met Natalie Portman disguised as a TSA agent.

I also found out that the highest high ground in the area was only a mere 35 feet above sea level.

Hast du jemals die Tragödie von Darth Plagueis "der Weisen" gehört? Ich dachte nicht. Es ist keine Geschichte, die die Jedi dir erzählen würden. Es ist eine Sith-Legende. Darth Plagueis war ein dunkler Herr der Sith, so mächtig und so weise konnte er die Macht benutzen, um die Midichlorianer zu beeinflussen, um das Leben zu schaffen ... Er hatte solch ein Wissen von der dunklen Seite, dass er sogar die von ihm gepflegten halten konnte Sterben Die dunkle Seite der Kraft ist ein Weg zu vielen Fähigkeiten, die manche für unnatürlich halten. Er wurde so mächtig ... das einzige, was er fürchtete, war, seine Macht zu verlieren, was schließlich, natürlich, er tat. Leider lehrte er seinen Lehrling alles, was er wusste, dann tötete ihn sein Lehrling im Schlaf. Es ist ironisch, dass er andere vor dem Tod retten könnte, aber nicht selbst.

2017/07/28 - 16:26:45 New comment by: WikiTextBot
**Palapa (structure)**

A palapa (a Spanish word of Mayan origin, meaning "pulpous leaf") is an open-sided dwelling with a thatched roof made of dried palm leaves. It is very useful in hot weather and, therefore, very common on Mexican beaches, such as in Acapulco. It is perhaps one of the most important architectural contributions of West Mexican culture.

Palapas are also common in Honduras and other Central American countries.

I like it. The Jedi boy is maimed but survives Skywalker's brutal onslaught by playing dead. He escapes to the underbelly of Coruscant, where he learns the harsh side of existence in a gang of outcasts and hard-lucks. Gradually, he uses his hidden Force talents to build influence in the criminal underworld while he waits for Vander end the Emperor to fall. Then, he takes his revenge on the Skywalkers by corrupting Luke's nephew and destroying the New Jedi.

He is so strong and big he even can use the original dint to create life. He is very deep to black influence understanding. The black influence can the matter that many supermans. But other people thinks that these are what can't attains. He become more and more strong and big. Lost his power afterwards afterwards he died. In fact he teaches own the whole skills all to disciple. Then his land killed him to let him going to bed.

Well, there are a few prevailing opinions about the prequels around here.

1) The prequels were under appreciated masterpieces wrongfully spurned by OT fan boys.

2) The prequels was horrendous but the world building was really good and offset the horrible dialogue, acting performances and crap direction.

3) The prequels in the category of so bad they turn around become awesome (à la The Room, Space Mutiny, and The Happening).

4) The prequels are simply superior for their ability to make funny memes and if you're wondering about lore and Canon, and other nerdy facts, repeat to yourself 'It's just for memes.' you should really just relax.

Today is history. Today will be remembered. Years from now the young will ask with wonder about this day. Today is history and you are part of it. A thousand years ago, when elsewhere they were footing the blame for the New Sith Wars, Valenthyne Farfalla told the Jedi they could come to Coruscant. They came. They flew their ships into the city. They settled. They took hold. They prospered in politics, the senate, the Force. They came with nothing. And they flourished. For ten centuries there has been a Jedi Galaxy. By this evening those ten centuries will be a rumor. They never happened. Today is history.

I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise, he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create...life. He had such a knowledge of the Dark Side, he could even keep the ones he cared about...from dying.

In canon, she's killed by Anakin in the temple
In Legends, she's killed by Anakin in the temple, but somehow escaped to Felucia, had an Apprentice and was killed by Starkiller.

Stuff like this is why Legends sucks, everything is so inconsistent, and its a lot harder to have a clear timeline. In Canon, the only inconsistent detail is when the Imperial Uniform was made.

The only reason they aren't Canon anymore is because Disney didn't give a single fuck about George Lucas, who said "you can make all the fan fictions you want, they just have to agree with the movies, and with each other's. Before the Force Awakens, the Canon was that Ben was Luke's son. But Disney threw that out the window, alienating tons of writers.

Fan Fiction describes the EU perfectly. The majority of it is trash, but there are a few gems here and there. For every Thrawn trilogy there is a Splinter of the Mind's Eye or Black Fleet Crisis. Say what you will about TFA, but the Canon universe as a whole is much better, and much more coherent.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Calamity Ganon The Powerful? I thought not. It’s not a story the Sheikah would tell you. It’s a Yiga legend. Ganondorf was a Dark King of the Gerudo, so powerful he could use the Triforce to create darkness… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Triforce is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, part of his plan to obtain the Triforce was to let the Hero of Time obtain the Master Sword, then the Hero sealed him away with the help of the princess. Ironic. He could save others from doom, but not himself.

It doesn't have to be a complete adaption of the video game, you could change the storyline so that it's not related to him help found the rebellion. His power isn't as important since he dies at the end anyways. The comics don't cover everything, he was kept a secret for a reason and didn't meet Vader very often.

We mostly all lived in a bubble and didn't pay attention to the government or politics, now we all have to pay the price. Democracy REQUIRES the active and informed participation of the people, or we quickly slide into corruption, kleptocracy, even dictatorship. This is true for conservatives, liberals, every political stripe; we always have to pay attention to what our leaders do on our behalf. Like the old saying, "The price of liberty is eternal vigilance".

That said, I don't think it will be like this forever. This is a very unusual time in US politics, and I hope we don't see it again for a long long time. One party has majority control of all three branches of the Federal government, control most State governments as well, and yet are pushing changes that most Americans don't even want, like scrapping the EPA, healthcare reform (the ACA I mean) and net neutrality. Meanwhile the President is uniquely incompetent and bizarrely arrogant, and it's increasingly apparent he does not even know how government works.

Hopefully this will all end quickly and spectatularly, I also do not want this chaotic, over-politicized situation to drag on for years and years. Even then, though, more people need to keep at least a casual interest in national politics so that we can avoid repeating this situation.

Translated it back to English:

Have you ever heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the Wise"? I did not think. It is not a story the Jedi would tell you. It is a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a dark master of the Sith, so powerful and wise he could use the power to influence the Midichlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge from the dark side that he even got that from him Maintained could dying The dark side of the force is a way to many abilities that some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful ... the only thing he feared was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It is ironic that he could save others from death, but not himself.

In cut canon she would have been killed by Greivous. I think this detail should have been kept cuz lots of people didnt take Greivous seriously when watching Ep 3 even though he was supposedly the Jedi slayer.

I guess there was so much content planned for Ep 3 something had to be cut..

Legends doesnt suck. Just because someone decided the clone wars is more canon than great video games and books just means it is part of the new story... By your logic, they could've said the clone wars is NOT canon and Force Unleashed IS canon and therefore the clone wars sucks. The real canon should've been the deleted scene in episode 3...

No, what I'm saying is Legends contradicts itself all the time. The new canon is clean and cut. The only thing that stayed after Disney took over was the movies and Clone Wars. I didn't say Force Unleashed sucked, It's a fun game, but it doesn't mean Legends is better ( And why would a DELETED scene be Canon?)

2017/07/28 - 19:50:15 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

Here's the thing about this. I understand this is a meme format, and I understand the intentions aren't necessarily political. It's the comment section that usually poses the problem. These kinds of posts aren't common enough where we have procedure on how to handle it, it's usually just a one size fits all since they get massive amounts of reports anyway. "No political posts" is an easier guideline for everyone to follow rather than a "maybe" which either results in inconsistent decisions between mods or other mods just asking me to make a judgement call.

^This. There's a huge fan base for TOR era stories, which would normally be too big for Disney to ignore if they want that cash money. But for some reason, maybe nostalgia or maybe the wider audience, Lucasfilm continues to focus on the movie eras and the Skywalker family. We already know they don't mind adult themes after seeing Rogue One.

It's possible that she was a with lord, who helped Sheev to seduce Dooku to the dark side. In a deleted scene of ep2 she mentioned to obiwan her admiration of Dooku, and she survived the Jedi purge somehow. Coincidences? I think not

And that utter horse shit scene where she "overpowers" Kylo's force grab move? That sealed in that Rey is perhaps the biggest Mary Sue we've ever seen in cinematic history. 

"But but but he was wounded!!!!!!!!111! Chewie shot him with that bow thing that launches people 50 feet back!!!1!!111"

Wow, I guess that fills in *that* plot hole! What a convenient way to dismiss any criticism against the fight. Bull. Shit.

I like TFA because it looks good and has interesting characters. The action scenes are well done. I like Han Solo's emotional Arc, as well as Rey's.

In terms of story, it is probably the least interesting of the saga, because it seems mostly concerned with giving the fans what they "want". If TLJ is a good follow up, it will be redeemed.

Relatively true, but at the same time, Disney is potentially getting rid of everything that the Prequels and OT stood for, like the fact that they want to get rid of the Jedi and the Sith.

2017/07/28 - 21:48:57 New comment by: EctoSage
I think story wise, with the exception of the planet sized plot hole, it was decent, but referenced A New Hope a bit too much.  
Desert planet-> free prisoner-> Destroy planet killer.  

Has a lot of extra stuff, that make some hefty changes, but man, that overall Arc is way too similar for me. Again, do away with the Star killer, and actually light the movie correctly, and give us some good eye candy, and it would be a decent Star Wars film.  
As it stands now, it aesthetically feels like a middle of the road fan film.

Alderaan and Jedha were infested with rebels. The regular military couldn't hold against them so they used a more drastical solution. They didn't target alderaanians or jedha holy city residents. They are casulties of war provoked by the all righteous rebels. Tarkin didn't want to kill those civilians, but if that meant the end of the Rebellion, he accepted the cost.

Scarif was a military base with no civilians. Also got destroyed because of the rebels, not because Tarkin was trigger happy.

Dark lighting on the film is probably my biggest gripe, or at least tied with the Star Killer- because in all of the past movies, and even Rogue One, the lighting always showed you the great details on the ships structures and creatures.  

PS: Man, that would have been incredible to see a battle between large ships. Usually when you see such a battle in Star Wars, it's a background element.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Jedi academy, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids against the Separatist Alliance and the Sith, and I have over 300 confirmed victories in lightsaber duels. I am trained in all forms of lightsaber combat and I’m the most accomplished master among all Jedi in form III Soresu. You are nothing to me but just another battle droid. I will cut one of your limbs the fuck off with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in this Galaxy, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of probe droids across the Galactic Republic and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with the force. Not only am I extensively trained in the force and lightsaber combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Grand Army of the Republic and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the Galaxy, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” meme was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking fingers. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

I guess. But they at least continued the Sith v Jedi, even if in name alone. While disney is destroying the idea of users of the force that are one sided and are trying to bring the Grey Jedi into fore front, even thought the Grey Jedi are meant to be the beings that rose above the rest, not the heroes/cool lightsaber wielders of the universe.

[Retroactive Continuity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_continuity)

2017/07/29 - 02:18:42 New comment by: WikiTextBot
**Retroactive continuity**

Retroactive continuity, or retcon for short, is a literary device in which established facts in a fictional work are adjusted, ignored or contradicted by a subsequently published work otherwise intended to maintain continuity with the former.

THEORYCRAFTING TIME!

Palpatine, being a sith lord, had no qualms fraternizing with the ladies. Very few women could resist the wiles of Sheev "The Sexy Senate" Palpatine, and one woman he had his eyes on was Jocasta Nu. Jocasta was a jedi, but that wouldn't stop ol' Palpy, no sirree. Palpatine would go to have a secret love affair with Jocasta that spanned much of their lives and careers.

This is why Jocasta purposefully hid the creation of the clones, and therefore Palpatine's ultimate plan, from Obi Wan in the archives. She was secretly working for Sheevy the entire time.

Then, when Sheev and Jocasta start living their twilight years together, Luke Shitface Skywalker and his dad had to go and kill her Senatey-Poo and blow up the Death Star. Jocasta was on the Death Star, as well, and only barely escaped in a pod, though she was severely burned.

Over 20,000 years, if Obi-Wan is to be believed. The phrase "Over a thousand generations" pops up from time to time in relation to the Jedi and the Old Republic, and assuming it's not just hyperbole, galactic civilization has probably been around even longer.

Eh...

For me episode 7 was better than episode 1, but not as a good as episode 2 or 3.

Hopefully Episode 8 is better. (I don't like JJ Abrams, as he's now ruined Star Wars for me, just like he ruined Star Trek.)

It's in the same universe where Vader built C-3P0, R2-D2 was a key figure in the Clone Wars, and Rey meets Han Solo, defends herself against the New Vader who is Han Solo's son, finds Anakin's lightsaber, and tracks down a missing-for-years Luke Skywalker.

Everything is already so connected that it isnt a giant leap of faith to assume that Snoke and Rey are somehow connected to the Skywalker arc in some way we don't yet know

2017/07/29 - 04:41:31 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

This is the first time I've ever seen a model/render(?) of Snoke in the flesh (and not the hologram we get in TFA). I gotta say, this really makes him look human. I was kind of expecting him to be humanoid but not human.


I looked up the timeline, and there's about 54 years between that scene in RotS and TFA. That kid looks 6 or so, which would put Snoke at 60. He kinda looks way older, but I guess if you were to take into account the maiming plus whatever hell he went through afterwards plus any sort of Dark Side deformation, I guess that would work.


I realize what sub I'm in, but that picture of Snoke makes this slightly more possible in my head now...

That didn't stop every single cast member from the original films from showing up in this one. Plus with Lucas in charge of production it's pretty obvious that the next movie will have his own personal touch like the last one did.

We always new Anakin Skywalker was Luke's father. It wasn't a mystery. There was no plant. No question. There's no attention paid to it. It wouldn't even be a mystery if you had theoretically watched the series in order; it would just be a lie one character told another character. These movies have never been about the unknown. They've been about adventure, magic, and intergalactic starship dogfighting.its very straightforward. Snoke is Snoke.

Putting memes aside for the moment, what's the leading theory on Snoke right now?

2017/07/29 - 09:19:54 New comment by: rymden_viking
Well for one if this theory is true then the attempt on his life left Snoke scarred and deformed. Bane stated that the dark side was too powerful for the body, and that to get strongah would take a toll on the body. I always found that to be just a Sith wives tale to tell the apprentices. In his own book, Plagueis tells Sidious that it is random. And Revan taught that Sith who did not strive to achieve more power died out because they feared the changes to the body. Plenty of now non-canon theories in the books to say no one truly knows. But for me the dark side is an unnatural perversion of the Force (per the Clone Wars), not just a Yin and Yang thing. And since it is unnatural, I wouldn't be surprised that it just corrupts the body as well as the mind.

IN GALACTIC CONQUEST, you battle your enemy one planet at a time for total control of the galaxy. Every planet has two battlefields, you must obtain victory on both battlefields to control the planet. The winner of each battle chooses where to attack next. Each world you control grants your faction a planetary bonus that can be used to enhance your forces, or to sabotage your enemy. For example, if the Empire controls the planet Tatooine, Lord Vader will assist imperial troops by crushing rebel opposition during battle. With each victory your faction's dominance increases. After four victories your faction will be powerful enough to use the special bonus granted by your secret base (chose a planet to destroy). The empire can use their secret base to unleash the awesome power of the death star and obliterate a rebel planet completely.﻿

2017/07/29 - 12:40:37 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

The world building was pretty good in kotor 2, especially nar shadaa and onderon/dxun. 

But the story was... what? Kreia wants to destroy he force???? The republic is poor? The buildup was great but The ending wasn't satisfying at all imo.

I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Jedi Order, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on the Separatist army, and I have over 3000 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top commander in the entire Republic armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on Tatooine, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with shooting at me in this podracer? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the Outer Rim and your desert camp is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my midichlorians. Not only am I extensively trained in lightsaber combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Grand Army of the Republic and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the planet, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” shot at me was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking trigger finger. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

Have you ever heard the tragedy of Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight? I thought not. It's not a story the Darkwraiths would tell you. Gwyn was a member of the Four Lords, so wisr and powerful it was said he could influence the souls to create... light. He had such knowledge of the light side, he could keep the ones he loved from falling to the Abyss. The Lord Souls are a pathway to abilities some consider unnatural. The Age of Fire became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was the fire fading, which eventually, of course, it did. Unfortunately, Kaathe taught an Undead warrior everything he knew, then the warrior killed him in the Kiln. Ironic, he could save others from hollowing, but not himself.

2017/07/29 - 14:37:52 New comment by: sarpnasty
There is also no evidence against it. I doubt it's true. If this was written in the same vein as the first 6 movies, I would bet that Snoke was someone like that. I don't think he is. But when it comes to fan theory crafting, you can take any hint as foreshadowing. Usually there is foreshadowing in good fiction otherwise the story just seems completely made up. The trick is to figure out when something is being foreshadowed. It's always easier in hindsight.

You can't prove a negative. There is literally nothing I could say to prove what he is not. It's an impossible standard set by people who have no actual evidence to stand on. It's the same kind of argument flat earthers give to support their ideas.

 It's just nostalgia. If you didn't grow up with the series, you'll like LoK better.

TLA is very much geared towards kids and has a "Saturday morning" feel. It's still very good and has some great arcs, but is a just tinge too kiddish for my tastes. Just to quantify - this thread has me wanting to go back and rewatch LoK. I don't even remember anything from TLA that I'd desperately want to rewatch, on the other hand.

I've always found the character of Dexter Jettster to be painfully erotic. Those big, full lips, topped with that teasing mustache were far too much the first time I saw him on the big screen. My pre-teen mind was fascinated by the dirty thoughts that crept into my head. I spent countless hours lying in bed awake at night, hoping that Dex would crawl into bed with me, and manhandle me with his four beefy arms. Sometimes (in my fantasies) I would put on a robe and pretend to be his old friend Obi-Wan, and he would make me suck on his fingers while he was three knuckles deep in my ass. Good times.

ANH, ESB and RotJ released first.

ESB has Vader's identity as a huge plot twist, a momentous revelation --- if the mystery is no longer there, it ruins what is otherwise a powerful moment. 

George had the Prequels as an idea from the outset (Ep 4 - 6, not 1 -3), so why didn't he just start there? For impact.

That was always my assumption. In the OT, Sidious and Vader are both rather grotesque, then in the KotOR games you have an obvious progression becoming deformed as you move further to the dark side. But then the PT came out and Anakin got roasted in a volcano and Palpatine got tazed I felt they were moving away from the "Dark Side literally corrupts you" idea.

2017/07/29 - 15:51:23 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Sir Patrick Stewart "the wise?"

I thought not. It's not a story prequelmemers would tell you. It's a <em>Star Trek</em> legend.

Sir Patrick Stewart was an student of the Old Vic so talented and so wise he could use acting to influence the scripts to create... drama. He had such a knowledge of the dark side he could even keep under-written sci-fi sequels... from dying.

The dark side of acting is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

He became so respected the only thing he was afraid of was... losing his respect, which eventually of course he did. Unfortunately he taught the next generation of actors everything he knew, then he had to take roles voicing a cartoon poop.

Ironic. He could lend others gravitas... <em>but not himself</em>.

Vader had 3rd degree burns over most of his body, so we can't tell his skin condition. His eyes lost color after Mustafar though. Dooku never showed any signs of physical changes. Maul had the eyes, but his tatoos covered any skin changes. Malak had pale skin, that was it. All of these individuals were not particularly powerful in the Force - Dooku, Maul, and Malak were excellent swordsmen and Vader lost much of his power after Mustafar.  
  
In the RotS novelization, which was read and approved by Lucas before publication, it was stated that Palpatine was merely a mask for Sidious, and his true appearance was the grotesque form we know from Jedi. As his mask was to hide his true self, it was destroyed when he unleashed lightning on Windu. So maybe there is credence to the theory that the more powerful you become the more your body is changed.

Also, he is the first completely CGI human character in cinematic history! Literally decades before anything like this would be seen in other motion pictures, this 100% computer-generated character appeared in the original "Star Wars" movie in 1977 and still looks almost exactly the same way in "Rogue One" in 2016! That shows how dedicated the producers were: Almost forty years prior, they already had the technology to render this human character in a realistic way (his appearance is modelled after the likeness of British actor Peter Cushing) using the most state-of-the-art computers of the time. Even today's technology couldn't reproduce the same ingenious special effects they made at the time. Truly a milestone of movie magic.

I agree. It would be super disappointing to find out that the main villain is just some random person who hates Jedi. Vader is so much more compelling *because* of how connected he is. Palpatine is more threatening *because* of how close he was to the Jedi order.

I watched it last night, and let me give any of you who plan on seeing it some advice.

***DO NOT***

This movie fails at everything. It isn't even a good advertisement. I went in looking to make fun of it and laugh at it, but I couldn't. It's not a so-bad-it's-good movie, it's just bad. Don't go to see it as a meme because it'll even disappoint you as that. I have never been so angry at a film before.

rogue one was bad as well.  
as a film not affiliated to star wars, it might not be bad, but as a star wars film, it was about as fucked up as tfa was.  
the inconsistencies were there as well, maybe not that obvious, but quite as bad.  
and sorry to say so, but who thinks rogue one was better than tfa in a star wars context has no idea of star wars.

The difference is that Obiwan is a planner, very future -oriented. Quigon is focused completely on the current moment at all times. This, I think, is the primary reason for pretty much all the conflict in their partnership. 

Anakin and Obiwan have much the same problem. They approach problems very differently. Quigon didn't model for Obiwan a good way to handle differences of personality in an apprenticeship, and Obiwan doesn't do so well with moving out of his comfort zone. 

Tldr it's Quigon's fault Anakin turned.

People are so thrown off by the auto aim beam that they don't realise that even Mercy's pistol can drop her fairly easily. 

Try to learn typical Sym movement patterns and just don't let her get you panicked when she locks on.

If we're being serious about the characters, I actually think Qui-Gon would have been a much better master for Anakin. He would have been more understandingof Anakin's problems with the Council and, in my opinion, would have kept him on the light side. He would have been able to reason with him better because they are more alike.

Well, the devs have Super battle droids in game and the developers have actively said that they want to add the "WATCH THOSE WRIST ROCKETS" line to the game.

To be frank, the BF2 (ea) looks a lot more better than its predecessor.

However, be on your guard, anything and everything can go wrong in the last second.

Minor advantages, which are not advantages when all players can get them for free.

The difference between the purple card (which is highest tier the player can craft) and legendary (which player can only get from loot crates, which players earn for free) is about 5% difference, which is not going to give any significant advantages in grand scheme of things.

Not to mention, these micro transactions, while still probably affect loot crates and skins, replace the DLC, which means that every update will be free, which means that everyone gets access to new maps, heroes, weapons and vehicles without paying. (I mean, if you think about it, DLC's in most games are already P2W in online games, because you get weapons and stuff that others cant get until they buy the DLC)


Also, developers are positive about continuing update the game as long as possible (they talked about as long as there are players, which would be years.) for free (well technically the Micro transactions are the pay, but a small one in grand scheme of things.)

It seems they want do things just like in Titanfall 2 (which is still updated for free and it is a lot better in every way than its predecessor.)


Everything seems to be positive at the moment about the game, devs listening players, good changes, etc... which is why i am afraid something will go wrong.

Before Disney dismissed the old Canon and created the new one (there are still hints in the current canon about this).

Dooku's tipping point was when Qui-Gon died, he already believed that the Republic was corrupted and that the Jedi were doing the wrong thing by being the lapdog of the republic, instead of actual peacekeepers and he tried to reason with the Council, but when Qui-Gon died (his apprentice and dear friend) he lost all hope in the Jedi council and left the order.

He returned back... where ever the hell he originally lived and reclaimed his Count title.

It is not specified when Dooku met Sidious Frank, but because Sidious was offering big change for the galaxy, Dooku accepted and became his apprentice.

It is also hinted that he wanted to avenge Qui-Gons death and he knew that Sidious was reason why he died, which is also why he wanted to his master and even trying to recuit Obi-Wan to his cause.

Now i am not completely sure what parts of this are canon anymore (it is really convoluted).

But the main point is that Dooku might have not changed sides if Qui-Gon was still alive.

I like episode 3 a lot.  1 and 2 had they're flaws, but I appreciate them for what they are.  They added cool stuff, like super cool ideas.  Did they focus on things that weren't as cool as the other parts they just introduced? Yes, but they followed Anakin's story, it wasn't Star Wars: Darth Maul, or clone army, etc.  a lot of the flaws were made better through the clone wars shows.

TL;DR: not perfect, but great for what they are

I hope you are not serious. ANH and ESB are leagues better. ANH gets credit for introducing us to the Star Wars universe and having incredible special effects for its time. ESB is simply a very high quality move on its own merits. 

Ep. 3 isn't a good movie. It's the best of the prequels and *maybe* better than Ep. 6, but it isn't a good movie. Had Ep 3 been released as a standalone movie it would had been received about as well as Valerian or Jupiter Ascending. Which is to say cool concepts and niche audience, but not broadly appealing and largely forgotten.

I think another thing the Star Wars universe is particularly bad about is taking everything said in the movies literally. Darth Plagueis didn't literally have to have the ability to control life. Sidious, sorry Frank, could had just been making shit up to trick Anakin. But of course there are entire books written on the matter. 

There is a lot of other shit like that in the EU, where writers/fans create whole works based on stupid shit Lucas wrote.

Personally I despise David Prowse. I met him when he was doing a book signing at the store I worked at, all he was interested in was making as much money as he could, loads of young fans came to meet him but all he cared about was selling them pre signed pictures of himself for £25 each. 
I've never understood why he has any recognition at all, he was literally a guy in a costume just employed to prop up the Vader suit and wave his arms around.
I read that during press events and interviews for Empire he kept announcing to everyone that Vader was Luke's father before release day to gain attention from the press, even though he was specifically told not to do so by the studio. JJ Abrams refused to have him cameo or visit the set of The Force Awakens for this very reason. 

James Earl Jones is the true Darth Vader, a truly talented voice and character actor.

Here is the story for anyone confused

The last Jedi is truly about Boss Nass restoring the balance of the force from the Sith lord Jar Jar binks. Our hero Boss Nass was mind tricked into giving Jar Jar the rank of military officer in the phantom menace which set up the chain of events leading Jar Jar to rise into political power. He gave emergency powers to his apprentice (and puppet) Palpatine, to lead his empire. So fast forward to the last Jedi, Ray seeks out Luke for Jedi training but Boss Nass had beaten her to the planet and killed him by having the high ground  (the one trick Luke was never taught) this was essential because now Ray can get true Jedi training from a true Jedi to stop Jar Jar binks (who now calls himself Snoke) from ruling the galaxy.

No one ever talks about that. It's all, "ooh those poor furry Wookiees, how could those droids be so cruel?" No one ever stops to ask whether creatures known for ripping arms out of sockets might have done something to provoke them. I'm sick of this anti-droid prejudice and biased reporting everywhere.

It's an Egyptian legend. Maximilian Pegasus was a Millennium Eye wielder so powerful and so wise he could use the shadow realm to influence card games to capture souls. He had such a knowledge of the Millennium items that he could even see the cards his opponent played before activating them. The magic of ancient Egypt is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful that the only thing he was afraid of was losing his Eye, which eventually of course he did. Unfortunately he lost a tournament to the king of games, then Bakura took the eye in his grief. Ironic, he couldn't save his wife from death, only himself.

That was such a BS "feel good" ending that makes no sense. They retconned Yoda and Kenobi into having to get special training to become force ghosts...but murderous Anakin just "figures it out"?

Now that's a name I've not heard in a long time...a long time...

It may be treasonous to say, but I do like original old man Anakin. And, one of the few OT changes I don't mind, is young Anakin ghost...

...but I can't lie, if Lucas had made Obi-Wan and Yoda fade into their younger selves, I would have dug it. Like, gimme Ewan McGregor smiling as a younger Obi Wan where you can clearly see him about to say "hello there", please, k thx.

>I thought not. It's not a story the OC posters would tell you. He's a r/prequelmemes legend. Darth Repost was so powerful and so wise he could use OC to create reposts... He had such a knowledge of the repost he could even keep the memes he cared for from dying. The dark side of r/prequelmemes is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was being downvoted, which of course, he was. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything about reposts, then he downvoted him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from downvotes, but not himself.

2017/07/30 - 17:14:35 New comment by: DarthSamus64
I read an Obi-Wan book one time where Anakin, while his spirit was in the netherworld of the force, was contacted by Obi-Wan and Obi-Wan told him exactly what to do to manifest in the physical world.

Apparently spirits last a little bit of time in "The netherworld of the force", this is mentioned in Episode III by Yoda when talking about Qui-Gon. Qui-Gon never learned the ability but apparently managed to figure it out after like what was it.. 13 years?

The book isnt Canon anymore I guess but I didn't question it very much.

I paid attention :)


Seriously though, I went quite a while without watching any of the Prequels and then when I watched them, they all resonated with me rather differently than before. There was a 6-7 year gap between. I think I went from 21-28. 

It's funny, actually. My opinion of Sith improved slightly, my opinion of Clones plummeted, and my opinion of Menace improved moderately.

It's a depiction of the scene where Padme reveals that she is the real Queen of Naboo and kneels down and begs Boss Nass to help them fight the Trade Federation, that's why they are looking at Padme with shocked expressions.

The text is readable just not enough, it was difficult for me to read because I was quite tired and had to focus. Black probably wasn't the best color for the text, use a brighter color next time (not white). Yellow font is good because it references the text crawls but consider the background.

The death of Luke's aunt and uncle at the hands of the empire help push Luke to join Obi-Wan and become a Jedi. Before that he was very unsure about what to do. 

Who knows, if the stormtroopers weren't sent down there, Luke might have blown Obi-Wan off, farmed for one more year, and then joined the academy like he said he wanted to do. 

The story might have been way different.

2017/07/30 - 20:55:05 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

IIRC Maul wasn't trained to be a Sith Lord, but as an assassin. Sheev gave him the title of Darth as "a sign of his loyalty" rather than his prowess and temperament as a dark lord.

Ani was born in a time of peace and prosperous pupils. There was a large group to choose from and many factors as to why he was not ideal for selection. 

Luke on the other hand was the only one capable of bringing peace to the galaxy. Yoda realized even though Luke was extremely old to start training, it was necessary given the circumstances.

2017/07/30 - 22:41:25 New comment by: WikiTextBot
**Convergent evolution**

Convergent evolution is the independent evolution of similar features in species of different lineages. Convergent evolution creates analogous structures that have similar form or function but were not present in the last common ancestor of those groups. The cladistic term for the same phenomenon is homoplasy. The recurrent evolution of flight is a classic example, as flying insects, birds, pterosaurs, and bats have independently evolved the useful capacity of flight.

There's something genuinely, innately sad about the fact that George Lucas basically said "Yeah, this is how I *wanted* the movie to be, but I think we can still try to make it less shit than it turned out".

On the one hand, I kinda respect that he didn't just do what a lot of directors do and go "It's perfect exactly like this, because this is how I wanted it.", but it's still got to suck to work and something for years with a massive crew of people, then look at the final product and think "This really isn't that great."

Did you ever hear the tragedy of George Lucas "the wise"? I thought not. It's not a story the sequels would tell you. It's an OT and prequel legend. George Lucas was an American film director, so beloved and so recognized he could use his fame to influence the studios to give him... full directive control over the prequels. Unfortunately, he may have went too far in a few places, then the prequels were poorly received while he slept. Ironic. He could become beloved for the original trilogy, but not the prequel trilogy.

lol my nephew got some of these for Christmas. They really are ridiculous. It almost felt like playing with Lego, the way you could reconfigure them to pretty much any shape.

In revenge of the sith, when yoda says "failed, I have. Into exile, I must go", he isn't referring to losing the duel with sidious. He is referring to the fact that he has failed to lead the Jedi order and follow the will of the force. The order has become a tool of the republic, and follows its' orders rather than the force's.  

One of the biggest mistakes that he and the council made was to suppress emotions, especially the negative ones, rather than deal work through them and learn to control them. The reason they took and trained only very young children was that they wouldn't have the emotional issues associated with leaving and being separated from their families. That's the reason they did not want to take anakin when he was nine. He had too many sad and angry emotions at the time. Of course, qui-gon trained him anyway. 

When he meets Luke, yoda refuses to train him at first, because he was afraid that he would make a mistake and lead Luke down a dark path. He made like pursue his training, to be sure he was committed, then he forces him to face his fears and hatred in the cave. Yoda knew that in order for the Jedi to rise again the training would require a different method, and that method was facing and overcoming the darkness within. Embracing its presence and mastering it.

Regardless of whether or not it's canon you can't deny that's some serious stretching to justify something that wasn't ever meant to be thought about. Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Anakin (Sebastian Shaw, the *only* Anakin in Return of the Jedi as far as I'm concerned ) become ghosts for the sake of a happy ending in Return of the Jedi, and Obi-Wan as a ghost exists pretty much exclusively to set the plot into motion in Empire Strikes Back. You can't justify things in a film using media outside of the film, it's like when people like to say Grievous is a good villain because *he was cool in the books*.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

TFA isn't my cup of tea, I have many problems with it mainly with just creativity and world building, but I don't hate it, like it is my second least fav Star Wars episode.  However, I mainly just hate the background of the movie because when it comes to Star Wars I love the different species, planets, ships, etc.  TFA was not the best with that and it didn't reuse the older species.  I'm also still salty that Clone Wars was cancelled, so overall I don't hate the movie entirely, but I just don't like the era/background that much

The only thing that distanced itself from the prequels is TFA. Rogue One had Bail Organa and Mustafar, rebels has clone wars characters, and EA's battlefront 2 has a strong emphasis on the prequels. The director of The Last Jedi also defended the prequels on twitter. I think it was mostly J.J. Abrams distancing himself from the prequels.

I thought this was a panel from the Darth Vader comics where he has the high ground against Vader. (it's a happening in Vader's mind)

In that issue, Vader calls Anakin a child, and that he (Vader) is experienced in killing children.

Not really, you can always do:

* 1. Lightsaber pikes (spears) which have not been in the movies or Canon yet.

* 2. Lightsaber knife/dagger (basically very short light saber with short grip)

* 3. Lightsaber with a single crossguard (so you don't burn yourself like Kylo)

* 4. Lightsaber tonfa (i would imagine this being hard to use)

* 5. Lightsaber axe (Because why not)

* 6. Lightsaber war pick.

* 7. Lightsaber with blaster attached (Rebels had a similar thing, but it did not shoot blaster shots... it shot some energy balls.)

There are still lightsabers in Legends and you can still create new lightsabers by just looking at melee weapons used in history and try to make them bit more SW like. The toy sellers versions are usually about: how can we make this more impractical than it needs to be?

Low ground is the easy path, it is strong... addicting... but also corrupting and leaves you scarred and deformed.

High ground is the hard path, but it is more rewarding and it grants you power far greater than you could ever imagine... however the downside is that twice the height, double the fall.

Pretty much, most characters have been grown up since Anakin which makes sense because the galaxy is constantly at war and it wouldnt make a good movie if they suddenly slowed it down to have a proper training. In addition to that, there are no Jedi to train anyone anymore within a large community because of the Senate. But, should things calm down in the next two movies, we may get more movies similar to the prequels as the Jedi at that time were at full power.

I feel bad for the guy, he was given the worst possible script to read from and it tainted his career. I'm sure he has a ton of money from SW, but that's not all a person wants in life. I bet he's disappointed that he can only get roles in movies that can't break 40 in Metacritic.

It's true, even if an admin deleted a page on Wikipedia, it's not truly deleted.  It's just hidden from public view so only admins can see it.  (There are a few cases, though, where a page is hidden from most admins, too, but it's still never truly deleted.)

Johnny Depp just wasn't a good Willy Wonka, and the backstory with his dad was completely unnecessary. I don't want to know his backstory, it's unimportant.

What I did like about the newer movie, however, was how the Oompa Loompas' songs were adapted nearly word for word from the book's excellent rhymes.

Gene Wilder is the *real* Willy Wonka.

I think one big difference between the movies is that it is Wonka that gets more attention than Charlie in the movie and i think Tim Burton wanted to build his charracter more.

Then theres of course the big difference between the Wonka's personality, the new Wonka was more shut in person and not good at talking to others (i would guess he was made to be Autist in the new movie).

However i liked the movie as it is. I have not read the book but i think it was good as a stand alone movie, as its own thing.

Granted, Ewan is older but he'll be the one called in for any future movies, not Hayden. It's a bummer, Hayden isn't a terrible actor, he just had one of the worst scripts ever to perform from.

Dark Plagues was a Darth Duke of the Sith, so strong and so smart he could use the Power to convince the chlori-midians to give... birh. He knew so much about the darth side he could even prevent his friends from ceasing to live. The darth side of the Power is a road to several skills some believe to be supernatural. He grew so strong... the only thing he feared was losing his strength, which eventually, obviously, he did. Sadly, he instructed his student on everything he knew, then his student murdered him while he napped. Sarcastic. He could rescue others from dying, but could not do the same for his own person.

Technically, the gravity from something that big alone could be used as a weapon. Merely being near the targeted planet would alter the orbit and create immense tides. If one is patient, the inhabited planet will freeze/roast about half way into its new year. If you aren't patient but have time to crunch numbers, you could set the position of the Death Star between a moon and the planet in such a way as to cause a collision.

Why even add planet destroying lasers. Just arm the thing to the teeth as a mothership (at this scale it could even be a Matriarch), blockade the targeted planet, and watch as everyone on the surface panics day by day as the moon grows closer.

It was supposed to be closer to the book I believe. Wonka was a very reserved man who lived by himself as a kid/teenager and hadn't seen another person in 20 years before re-opening the factory. I guess it was kind of a realistic horror where a man has all the possessions he's ever dreamed of but has no people in his life, leaving him hollow and act weirdly when meeting people.

I write loads about the prequels and defend them to the manchildren and prequel hate meme followers. I feel like TFA is going the same way a little with the hatred because the prequel generation is growing up and feel the same towards TFA as some oldsters towards the prequels. I enjoy it as a film, but when some of the criticism is pandering to the old crowd and complete unoriginal, I can't disagree. TFA was not innovative at all

If you all haven't seen it, *Life as a House* is probably my most favorite of Hayden's movies. It's not very well acted, (which of his films are?), but his interaction with Kevin Kline was worth it.

Let me fix that for you: 


Darth Plagueis était un Seigneur des Ténèbres des Sith, si puissant et si sage qu'il pouvait utiliser la Force pour influencer les Midichloriens pour créer la vie ... Il avait une telle connaissance du côté obscur qu'il pouvait même garder ceux dont il se souciait de mourir. Le côté obscur de la Force est un chemin vers de nombreuses capacités dont certaines considèrent comme non naturelles. Il est devenu tellement puissant ... la seule chose dont il avait peur perdait son pouvoir, ce qui finalement, bien sûr, il l'a fait. Malheureusement, il a enseigné à son apprenti tout ce qu'il savait, puis son apprenti l'a tué dans son sommeil. Ironique. Il pourrait sauver les autres de la mort, mais pas lui-même.

I disagree, mainly because it merely slows down time instead of stopping it and you need to activate criticals instead of it being based on perks. But that also ties in with how they destroyed perks and skills too.

I once used a Yoda quote to seduce a high school class mate. The quote? You'll need to know the context:
She texts me:
Her: "How are you."
Me: "[gives a sensuous description of my physical satisfaction at that moment having just enjoyed some dank Mexican food]"
Her: "I wish I was on your level."
Me: "I can take you there."
Her: "You can try."
Me: "Do or do not, there is no try."
{Speech check successful}
Her: "Do."
I had a 10% experience point bonus not long after that, if you know what I mean.

2017/08/01 - 00:20:22 New comment by: Solocle
Obi Wan has powers in Certain Points Of View that Anakin can only dream of.

By using his powers, Obi Wan was able to take the moral high ground, which was the real reason that he won on Mustafar.

The lack of physical high ground on the Death Star, combined with the lack of high ground in a circle that is now complete, is why he died at Yavin.

Slowing down time meant you could go in vats, go make a four course meal, come back and then continue playing. If a Super Mutant Suicider was literally right next to you, you couldn't hit the V key and be safe. And the activation of criticals was a neat aspect, and it was governed by the luck tree, which was the only tree in the game that had truly unique perks in stead of just stat boosters.

Okay, the pause button and pip-boy also do this. I don't see the problem here.

There were none in NV or 3 afaik, but I get your point. However, once you fired, you were able to be harmed by NPCs before regaining control of your character. 


Overall, it doesn't make sense that you can only critical one enemy every so often and you have to activate it. It should just happen in normal combat, which I don't think it does. 

I'm very displeased that they didn't put skills in the game. It would solve the whole critical thing with guns skill and perks that directly affect the gameplay instead of bolster stats

If you ask the Chinese, they will tell you that they are communist.

>China's constitution states that The People's Republic of China "is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants," and that the state organs "apply the principle of democratic centralism." The PRC is one of the world's few remaining socialist states openly endorsing communism.

Aegon the Conqueror was a Targaryen king, so wise and powerful, he could use his dragons to influence Westeros to bend the knee.

Let's ask the Chinese what to call their form of government.

>China's constitution states that The People's Republic of China "is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants," and that the state organs "apply the principle of democratic centralism." The PRC is one of the world's few remaining socialist states openly endorsing communism.

2017/08/01 - 04:13:10 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

You can live without laugh. I know you can. You think it's making you feel alive, but damnit it's the very thing keeping you from life.

Understand, brother, that life isn't about snorting laugh all day. And it's not about friends or love or relationships or charity either. That shit is lame. Life is about prequel memes. Life is about shitposts. Life is about prequel memes 24-7. That's where real happiness comes from. Not from some artificial drug like laugh. And not from being kind and helpful to people. It comes from memes, brother. Prequel memes.

Wait. Anakin was "supposed to bring balance to the force" as the prophecy suggested. But there was a whole shitload of jedi and just a few sith. So by Anakin turning, he _did_ bring balance to the force, as Yoda/Obiwan and Frank/Vadar were all that was left.

I can wake up at a pre chosen time also. I just need to look at a clock before I fall asleep and tell myself when to wake up. I need at least 4 hrs sleep to do this and find I don't feel sleepy when I wake up . I didn't use an alarm clock for many many years, and only fell back into using an alarm recently because I started using the one on my phone

Qui-Gon, I've been wondering. What are memes?

Memes are a microscopic life form that resides within all living cells. Without memes, life would not exist. And we would have no knowledge of the prequels. They continually speak to us, telling us the will of the prequels. When you learn to quiet your mind, you'll hear the OC speaking to you.

Wait, do you mean the political and economic destruction wrought by glasnost/perestroika which has lead to a elite political/business cabal that has thrust Putin into a virtual autocratic rule over Russia..?

Jesus you're thick. Let me be explicit enough that you don't have to put any thought into it whatsoever:

Oh gee whiz, it was only its own country with its own people and government! Why ever would it be considered a separate entity?

The destruction happened after glasnost/perestroika. That's, what, the third time I've said it now? Do you need me to make it more simple for you?

>If pre preistroika/glastnost ussr was so great, why did they happen at all?

Either your IQ is barely breaking double digits or you're the most obtuse and smug person I've had the misfortune of encountering in recent times.

The could war's over, Boris. You can't just act sumg on the assumption Uncle Joe will roll tanks through Canada and make everything all right.

Communism is a dead 20 century ideology, just like Nazism. Get over yourself.

That clearly demonstrates that they would call themselves Socialist. Endorsing communism doesn't mean you've achieved it, it just means you want to.

Communism is a classless, stateless, moneyless society and is sort of an "end goal", that's why countries ran by communists called themselves socialist instead of communist.

Whether or not they actually are socialist is another debate, but no socialist state has ever claimed to have achieved communism because, well, they haven't.

There is only one kind of communism: A classless, stateless, moneyless society.

Being ran by communists =/= communism. Hence why places like the USSR called themselves socialist rather than communist.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

I live in Ukraine, Kiev, I was born in 1980. I've seen USSR for only 11 years, but that was enough. It was a completely corrupt society, where leaders of the party were nothing different from a kings. My grandfather and grandmother almost died in the holodomor, while those pricks in the Moscow were eating delicacy from all around the world. There was nothing "equal" in Soviet Union. Modern Ukraine has many different problems, but I would take it over USSR any day.

> Darth Doggo was a bark Lord of the dogs, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the hoomans to create life... He had such a knowledge of the bark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The bark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his bork, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his master everything he knew, then his master loved him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from being goodboye, but not himself.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of President Davis "the Confederate"? I thought not. It's not a story the Union would tell you. It's a Southern legend. President Davis was a South Lord of the Darks, so cruel and so powerful he could use States Rights to influence the poor Southerners to fight for the rich... He had such a knowledge of the Declaration of Independence he could even keep the peculiar institution he cared about from illegality. The plantation way of life is a pathway to political powers some consider to be... immoral. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his Governors everything he knew of States Rights, then they worked against him, and his secession acts became illegal. It's ironic he could save other acts from becoming illegal, but not his own.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plageuis the Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use Tinder to influence the women to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
The dark side of the Tinder is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice unmatched him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from loneliness, but not himself.

Yes, yes, I know:

General Reposti, you are a bold one.

Now there are two of them!

My allegiance is to original content, to karma. 

There's always another repost. 

But what about the droid attack on the Wookiees? 

I'll try reposting. That's a good trick. 

This is where the downvoting begins.

Memes that I have created over a very long career. Memes that make me a nightmare for people like you shitposters. If you let my voice go right now, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you....and repost your memes.

Seeing as Boba was on and around that planet an awful lot and then disintegrated the extended family, I assume another droid bounty hunter, IG-88, may have been there too and caused a ruckus going after clientele who frequented it and were often wanted on 3 systems. I figure bounty hunters could do some damage going after scum and villainy in that wretched hive and ole 88 had already done enough damage.

2017/08/01 - 22:11:37 New comment by: theveryuniqueusernam
It's people like you that make mad. I was raised by a droid, and he worked his exterior plating off just to feed me. I'll never forget the day I realized just how much he did for me. 
Fixing moisture vaporators doesn't pay well. Every night he would come home, sand stuck in his joints, plating hanging on by a little bit of rust. He saved and saved his hard earned credits until one day I noticed he had taken all of our savings to work. When he returned, he was holding a nice, shiny new pair of electrobinoculars. As he handed them to me, I swear his holo receptors lit up a little more. "But DAd-D0," I remember saying, "what about you? You're nearly broken down to Jawa scrap!" Do you know what he said to me? He said "son, I'm just a droid. One day any of my components could give out and I'll be useless. But you- you're young and human and have a world to explore. Although I didn't truly appreciate what he had done at the time, I ran up and hugged his cold, metallic leg. God I wish I had seen it then.
But I didn't truly appreciate him until that fateful night. DAd-D0 had been saving his credits for months- but this time it was for his repairs. So he told me, anyway. He took me with him to the mechanic, circuits buzzing with excitement. Only when we gor there, I could see it wasn't a mechanic at all- it was a cantina! DAd-D0 had saved all those credits to take me here! The cantina was buzzing with life. There were Rodians playing sabaac in the corner, twi'leks taking drink orders, and even some freakish hairy dude talking to a guy in a hood. That was one of the best moments of my life- that is, until it wasn't.
"Hey!" The words cracked the air like a whip. "We don't allow your kind in here!" There had to have been a mistake! Was it because I was human? White? A prequel fan? Only after he explained did I realize. "Your droid will have to wait outside!" This couldn't be happening. Not accepted because he was a droid? Mechanical, yes, but an intelligent, paying customer! My heart sank. Reluctantly, DAd-D0 handed me his credits and shuffled outside. I had no Idea what to do, but the waitresses were pressuring me, so I sat down and ordered. After hastily finishing my meal (the best meal of my life), I rushed outside to find DAd-D0 gone. Taken by those moronic Jawa retards. I was devastated.
So don't even talk to me with your "he'd just take up space" mister. Your human privilege is the product of years of ignorance about droids. Droids are contributing members of society and they deserve to be treated as such. I will never forget my experience in that cantina and I will never let anyone else repeat it.

It's all Obi-Wan's fault. He's jealous. *He's downvoting my posts!*

He feels my memes are too dank. He won't let me post OC. It's worse... he's overly critical... never reads them. He doesn't understand.

I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

Pretty sure it has been confirmed that that is not the hull of the Death Star but rather a prototype to see how it would work. Which makes since as there is no way within a score that the Death Star was put together from start to finish without some tweaking and reworking. Sometimes projects are scrapped and redone from the ground up.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Ditto The Cute? I thought not. It’s not a story the Cats would tell you. It’s a Doggo legend. Darth Ditto was a Derp Lord of the Doggos, so lovable and so ditzy he could use the Adorableness to influence the Owners to give him pets… He had such a knowledge of the Derp side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from stealing his food. The derp side of the Adorableness is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be impossible. He became so lovable… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his cuteness, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice stole his food in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from having their food stolen, but not himself.

Did you ever hear the copypasta of Darth Plagueis The Dank? I thought not. It's not a story 9Gag would tell you. It's a Reddit legend. Darth Plagueis was a moderator of r/PrequelMemes , so powerful and so dank he could use the Force to influence the internet to create... memes. He had such a knowledge of the internet, he could even keep the memes he cared about... from dying. The dank side of the Force is a pathway to many abilites, some considered to be unnatural. He became so dank.. the only thing he was afraid of was losing his dankness, which eventually, of course he did. Unfortunately, he taught Redditors everything he knew, then Redditors downvoted him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save memes from dying, but not himself.

Vader had no idea Kenobi was on Tatooine until after IV.  Fett was looking for Threepio and R2 and it took him to Owen and Beru.  

Fett found Obi's hut between Hope and Empire and ran into Luke there finding out Luke was the one he was tracking and blew up the DeathStar.

Jesus, are you dense? First you're saying that everyone should have spaceships and then when I asked you to elaborate on your "logic" instead you decide that nobody would have them.

Let me be as explicit as possible:

Can you please tell me how you have connected the idea of a mobile phone being invented to the belief that everyone in the USSR should/shouldn't have (you can choose either depending on how you're feeling at the moment) spaceships?

Jesus, you are dense. All I said was that the predecessor to cell phones was invented by a man in the USSR.

That's it. Nothing more. Nothing less.

Nobody mentioned anything close to "implying" that every Soviet citizen had phones/could have phones because the first one was invented by Kupriyanovich. Nobody mentioned space ships. This whole thing was a fantasy conjured up in your mind, utterly divorced from reality.

Go back over the comment thread and this time, instead of reading what you want to believe, follow what is written and see just how daft you've proven yourself to be.

I was talking to this girl once, and somehow the subject of beaches came up. She mentioned something to the effect of "hating the sand because it gets everywhere." I was unsure if she was actually testing my prequel meme consciousness or if it was a coincidence.  I knew if I said something like "Yeah, sand is so coarse" I would have sounded completely autistic if it was just a coincidence. I ended up continuing through the conversation, pretending like nothing was out of the ordinary, never knowing if she was truly versed in the art of Star Wars references.

Jesus, do you walk into the middle of conversations and start shouting over the top of people about irrelevant things in real life, or is this confined to your online behavior?

The comment I replied to was implying that iPhones were created under capitalism and as such there would be no iPhones. I provided a rebuttal to that idea because the first mobile phone was built in the USSR to show that inventions occurred in the USSR and that inventions are political/economic-system agnostic.

Then you stumble in talking about your own special brand of "logic", which you have since recanted, that means everyone in the USSR should have spaceships or some shit. It's taken half a dozen replies just to get you somewhere in the vicinity of explaining whatever the fuck you are on about.

Seriously, do yourself a solid and read the comment thread. Not with your shitty, off-base inference (and certainly not trying to pass off that inference as my implication.) Not attached to your username and mine. Just read it as if it were a discussion or a passage of a book's dialog. If you have any insight you'll see that one person is ranting about logic and implications and spaceships, and the other person is desperately trying to get them to: a) be clear b) make a point c) explain the reasoning behind that point d) explain the relevance of the point.

I'd be mortified if I wrote the sort of nonsensical, rambling, non-sequitur garbage that you do.

Qui-Gon, I've been wondering. What are memes?
Memes are a microscopic life form that resides within all living cells. Without memes, life would not exist. And we would have no knowledge of the meta. They continually speak to us, telling us the will of the prequels. When you learn to quiet your mind, you'll hear the memes speaking to you.

Not in California, as far as I've experienced. Openly racist people get beaten in CA. No one would be racist in Hawaii for sure as well, they are accustomed to tourists from around the world. The Rockies and Utah I can't speak for, as I've never been there, but even when I went to Virginia I never saw my colored friends be treated differently. Racism kind of varies in the US, depending on location and race, but open violent attacks upon POC by normal citizens are usually extremely rare.

Tbh, now that you mention it I'm curious if it's intentional. The empire's design was meant to follow that of the Nazis, same for the First Order.

Fun story: My white great-great-great-grandfather was lynched by the KKK. He was a sharecropper, and the owner of the farm had hogs. One day, a hog got out and ate the neighbor's corn, who just happened to be a member of the KKK. Instead of taking it to the law, they lynched the owner and my ancestor.

Not to mention that a fighter operated by a Droid could accelerate orders of magnitude faster and a death star operated by droids wouldn't need to dedicate vast parts of it to housing and food storage/creation.

I think it's almost certain that any kind of civilization with the material wealth and skill to create something like a spacefaring battle ship would be staffed almost entirely with machines. 

Even in the improbable situation where somehow humans are better shots/pilots than AI, I think their numbers and physical advantages would outweigh the worse fighting skills.

2017/08/02 - 15:39:43 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

The first cross burning by the KKK occurred in 1915 to "celebrate" the formation of the 2nd Klan. However, it was a tactic mostly deployed in the late 1940's through the 1950's.

Obviously this doesn't matter in context to OPs post, just wanted to throw it out there.

2017/08/02 - 16:12:46 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

Just a slight change, the ships wouldn't need to be piloted by droids... they would just be droids themselves. The ship wouldn't even need a cockpit, as it's piloted by it's programming.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Jedi Academy, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on the separatists, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sword fighter in the entire Republic armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Holonet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the Republic and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Republican Clone Army and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

Both old canon and new canon say that the Battle Droids were:

1: Scrapped or sold or both.

2: Reprogrammed for other jobs.

3: Reprogrammed by the rebelion to fight for them.

4: Became independent (super tactical droid Kalani and his droids.)

5: In junkyard.

6: Repurposed by Empire.

7: Owned by criminals (Hutts acquire Magnaguards.)

I wouldn't say that. If anything it was hamstrung by the constant need for awkwardly accommodating old fan favorites. As much as the original films, the cast, and crew we're amazing spending so much time handing the legacy off instead building on its foundation.

Geth never got sudden sentience. Some spoilers ahead.

&nbsp;

Quarians upgraded the Geth over time, as they were their cheap work force and military support and even in time build them ability to link the Geths network with other close Geths, however this also boosted their intelligence and they started becoming more self aware over time, which the Quarians feared and decided that pulling Off switch would be a good idea, well of course the Geth tried to defend themselves and even managed to drive the Quarians off their planet.

&nbsp;

These events take place over 200-300 years before the first game starts.

&nbsp;

During the 1 and 2 games events, the Geth however do not have perfect AI, they need other Geth in their near area to boost their own intelligence and they even needed space stations where they could store their memories.

&nbsp;

During Mass Effect 3 the war between Quarians and Geth has escalated (because the Quarians really want their planet back) and because of fear and survival the Geth make a deal with Reaper.

Since the Reapers are... i don't even remember how old... 40.000 years?... over that? Well anyways, the Reaper was able to boost their intelligence but it required strong connection between the Geth and the Reaper.

Depending on players choices, the Legion (one of the Geth that was in players squad during last missions of the ME2 and appears as very important character in ME3) wants to use the (Now destroyed) Reapers code and download it to the Geth network to give all the Geth true independence and fully developed AI.

Player can choose to help them or... well... kill them all (Or third option is to bring peace, freedom, justice and security to the new Geth and Quarian ~~Empire~~ society, but only if you did the right choises.)

&nbsp;

There might be few mistakes here and there but it should be mostly accurate.

Legion explains most of the Geth thinking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1Z27W0f3IY

However...

Considering, humans and other aliens usually build the more intelligent machines after their image just to make us confortable near them.

This also means that we will program them in a way that they also act more like humans for example. Japanese  already experiment with the idea to build robots which task is to be your friend, to give you moral support and it will also react on things like not caring about it and other things.

Since we strive to make robots more like us, the robots will eventually also try to become us, which involves caring, existing and independace, but this would depend on how smart they are and how they are made.

Geth for example did not much care about becoming indivituals until they became interested with the concept and already had a small taste of it from the reapers.

And it also comes down to the notion that Vader and Annakin are two completely alternate entities. Annakin never did anything wrong in that regard, as it was the manifestation of Vader that committed all the horrors we witness throughout the saga. Annakin's redemption is more than just murdering good old Sheev, but it was silencing and destroying the entity that consumed him for so long. But that's just a certain point of view... It kind of provides clarity in how Annakin is able to become a force ghost.

2017/08/03 - 00:46:57 New comment by: direturtle
It would be a tough match. Obi-Wan is a bold one, which when activated negates the effects of his being not brave enough for politics. Once that is cleared up, it really comes down to his high ground versus The Senate's spinning. Spinning is Obi-Wan's natural and most formidable enemy, as spinning creates spatial disorientation and makes the status of the ground unclear. However, since Obi-Wan is in fact the undisputed high ground master and The Senate is *not* the master of spinning (that title is held by Anakin, of course, for whom it is a good trick), I would say that Obi-Wan has the edge and in a close contest would come out victorious.

You ever hear the tragedy of the Dragonborn? I thought not, it's not a story the Thalmor would tell you. It's a Norse legend. The Dragonborn was a favored soul of Akatosh, granted the ability to influence his vital essence to create shouts. He had such a knowledge of the voice. He was so powerful that the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which he never did. Unfortunately his apprentice killed a chicken by mistake, and the guards killed them.

2017/08/03 - 03:12:39 New comment by: darthplagueisbot
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

To me, Anakin always looks unintentionally sinister in this shot. It's the way his head is slightly tilted downwards. Maybe he's being smug, like, "Hehehe, looks like I got away with all that shit!"

This could be seen as an OT meme, Anthology meme, or even a Prequel meme if you treat Rogue One as an honorary prequel (I don't, because I think r/AnthologyMemes needs to get thrown a bone).  Sequel meme, not so much.

But where the rebels even the good guys in the story, or where they just glorified villains like breaking bad or mob movies.

Tbh I don't think Anakin redeemed himself. He wanted to kill Palpatine for a while, so it's not like he wanted to save the Rebellion or anything. For me the takeaway was that good is more powerful than evil, and that oftentimes there's a little bit of good in even the darkest people.

Anakin Skywalker was a good guy because of his deeds, saving the galaxy from unknown evil forces. He did it out of love for his family but ended up being heartbroken by his wrong choices. Darth Vader was forced by the emperor Palpatine to destroy the Jedi and all who rebelled against him. Luke Skywalker showed his evil father Darth Vader the way to forgive himself for the terror he caused in the past by overthrowing the emperor literally.

If you want to know what we will do with it, I plan on reading the whole thing to the Kiddos, and then having the Kiddos memorize it for homework and then we'll do some recitals, and then we'll do a few worksheets about it. Sound good? Unfortunately the gosh Damn superintendent has cut our Field Trip budget this year AGAIN so I can't ask you to join us at the Powell Museum of Agricultural History (which is how we rewarded our Literature Content Creators last year) but look, I want to show you that I really appreciate how much crystal clear you've made my lesson plan for the week - how's about you PM me your address and I'll send a crisp few 20 buckaroos your way, eh? Yes, it's out of my own pocket (gosh Damned Educational budgets!) but hey, the kiddos deserve to learn as much as we did when we were growing up, and I haven't been one of  Powel's Top 5 Accelerated Literature teachers for 2 of my 5 years here at Powell by being a cheapskate, I'll tell you that much ;)

Equating our judeo-christian views of the afterlife with the force is wrong IMO. Becoming one with the force isn't like going to heaven and it's not like the force is like God who punishes people for their sins. He just to become with the force after returning to light side of the force.

As /u/otherben says: 



"Vader killed a bunch of Jedi and never saw their bodies disappear. You think when he killed Obi-Wan and his body disappeared, Vader was just like "well that was weird, but definitely not at all worth following up on or researching or meditating on in any way"? Especially after the dude said "strike me down and I will become more powerful than you can imagine"?!?! You think Vader didn't feel Obi-Wan's ghosty presence when chasing Luke down the Death Star trench? You think Vader didn't intuit or sense where Luke was getting his guidance when they were dueling at cloud city? You think he decided to turn good and defeat the emperor and embrace love and all that, so the force just rewarded him with sudden mastery of the technique?

I think he became aware of it as Darth Vader, reflected on it through his memories of the Jedi and meditation, but knew there was no dark side path to force ghosting. I think it clicked for him at the same moment that he decided to return to the light, save his son, and destroy the emperor. I think the "chosen one" stuff meant that he was incredibly strong with the force, and was essentially formed by the living force originally, so this definitely helped him figure it out way way quicker after returning to the light than Qui-Gon or Obi-Wan or Yoda, but I don't think the "force did it" easy out explanation is totally necessary here."

Perhaps if he helps Mace instead then the Jedi attempt to take control of the government in the interim (as Mace had said they should do earlier in the movie), effectively replacing the democratically elected Chancellor with a Theocratic Military Junta. I do think many member systems would take issue with that, and might elect to bug the fuck out and join up with the Separatists (who would find that their droid armies were not shut down by Palpatine and their leadership not slaughtered by Vader). Who knows what new horrors we would arrive at with a renewed spark to the galactic war?

To be fair, there's a reason why the force ghosts of Obi Wan and Yoda were of their old selves. Anakin's redemption meant his Jedi self could be a Force Ghost. Death Vader was never a Jedi. As Obi Wan said in Episode 6 "He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker."  Anakin's Jedi self is his younger self. Hence if Anakin were to be a Force Ghost, his Hayden Christensen appearance makes sense.

According to the Clone Wars series, it's actually a special training that Qui-Gon started and didn't finish, and then guided Yoda to it. Yoda did finish it and teached Obi Wan. But at no point at all it is said or implied that Anakin did that training, becoming a force ghost is a huge plot hole.

Find a good one and work out a plan with the counselor sometimes known as a semesterly map.

Apply for the usual scholarships and grants.

And get familiar with school wide grading policies. At grossmont down here in social we get a rewrite over anything below 70% for classes as long as you take it again and pass. So some students use this to help avoid C' s which can be killers to transfer depending on your major.

I guess the rationale is that your force ghost comes back as your most "pure" form. Because Yoda and Obi Wan were pure their whole lives, they look old. Anakin looks how he did when he was last on the side of good.

So just goes to show you: if you're going to come back as a force ghost, turn really horrifically evil on a good hair, good skin day.

That's actually something that really bothers me about the Star Wars universe, is their use of language. Sometimes they change idioms to make them more star-wars-y (wild bantha chase) and sometimes they keep them the same for clarity (sitting ducks). Pick one and stick to it, please. It's okay to say "wild goose chase" if you're okay with saying "sitting ducks" and they're both okay in the Star Wars universe because they're idioms, not literal. The Basic that the characters would actually be speaking were the story real would use equivalent idioms, not literal translations.

Another thing that really bothers me about the use of language in Star Wars is curse words. People who write in the Star Wars universe seem to have decided that they needed to make up nonsense words to stand in for English curse words. NO. A made-up word doesn't have the same emotional punch as an English curse word, even if the reader knows exactly which English word the made-up word is referring to. That's the point of profanity, to pack an emotional punch.

One specific word that really bothers me is "younglings". *Ugh*. It *completely* breaks the immersion and sounds downright silly. There's no good reason to make up new slang words willy-nilly in a fantasy world just because you've got to remind people that it's a fantasy world.

Lord Vader merely acted on the authority given to Grand Chancellor Palpatine, who was elected and trusted by the Senate to lead the Republic, to eliminate the insurgent Jedi Order. He did nothing wrong.

I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

Ultimately I couldn't give a rats ass about what is canon and what isn't, but Disney still erased some of my favourite stories of that universe (including KotOR, the Karen Traviss novels, and the incredible 2D Clone Wars Series) from the whole story, and that kind of sucks.

Honestly this is one of the only special edition changes I'm completely fine with. The other one is putting Ian McDiarmid in the hologram in Empire. It's not changing events like Han shooting first or something, just updating continuity with the prequels.


Anakin literally never looked like that, it wouldn't be his image of himself. His redeemed spirit looks like he did back when he was whole.

Forgiving and accepting Vader's/Anakin's attempt at redemption is what makes good guys actually good guys. Yea, Vader's responsible for some pretty horrible things, but nobody can undo that anymore.

The Force isn't about good vs evil or right and wrong. Those are emotions held by Force wielding individuals and the powers they present are an emergent property of those emotions. 

The Force is literally a "Force" of nature and like nature it only strives for balance. 

The concept of forgiveness isn't something The Force is capable of. 

In the case of Anakin Skywalker his ability to manifest as a force ghost is a direct result of his strength and his having restored balance before his death. 

The Force itself only cares that he murderized a bunch of kids so far as its implications for light/dark balance in the universe. 

Had they not been force users the Force wouldn't give much of a shit other than for the meager amounts of The Force that runs through them as a natural byproduct of being a living entity.

2017/08/03 - 07:37:51 New comment by: FPSGamer48
Only a few Jedi knew how to tap into the ability to become Force Ghosts. In a deleted scene for RotS, Yoda mentions to Obi-Wan he spoke with Qui-Gon's force ghost, and knows how to conquer death (or something along those lines). This is also shown in the Clone Wars (in the final season). Basically, you have to accept death as it happens. Vader accepted it. Obi-Wan accepted it. Qui-Gon accepted it (he meditated before fighting Maul, if you notice). Yoda accepted it. Any of the Jedi killed during Order 66 couldn't have had time to accept it, and they didn't even know you could do that. 

It's kind of implied the knowledge of how to become one with the force was lost, and Qui-Gon rediscovered it sometime before Phantom Menace. So, no, only a few Jedi truly became one with the Force, and most probably weren't killed by Vader. 

Also, fun fact, technically, if he had died as Vader, and not as Anakin, he wouldn't have become a force ghost. Sith don't believe in an afterlife. Therefore, he couldn't have accepted becoming one with the force no matter what, because his beliefs would tell him there is nothing after. Now, perhaps that because he grew up a Jedi his views on an afterlife would be different, but someone like Palpatine, for example, wouldn't have a chance to become a force ghost.

2017/08/03 - 07:40:00 New comment by: FPSGamer48
The Sith wouldn't be able to do it, though. Sith doctrine state there is nothing after death. Therefore, they could never accept becoming one with the Force, meaning they can never actually become a Force Ghost. A self-fulfilling prophecy in a way. If a dark-side user were to kill themselves trying to become a force ghost, they wouldn't be able to, and there lack of re-appearance would solidify the claim among the other Sith that there is nothing after death.

2017/08/03 - 07:41:06 New comment by: FPSGamer48
For a few moments, the Force was balanced. There was one Sith (Vader) and one Jedi (Luke). Then, Vader died as Anakin, unbalancing it. I've never understood the Jedi ideology in that regard. Balance doesn't mean one thing exists the other doesn't. It means each side has an equal number. I think that's what Luke has figured out in Episode VIII, personally. That for there to be balance, there must be light AND dark, or neither light, nor dark.

Balance in the Force is a Jedi expression. So you can't define it objectively. By Jedi definition balance in the Force = eradication of the Sith. Nothing less, nothing more. Jedi believe the Force to be a companion, Sith believe it to be a slave. The Jedi categorize slaving the Force as breaking the balance between the Force and the Force user. That's why balance in the Force has nothing to do with numbers of either order. Sith are now gone, therefore balance is restored.
What balance DOESN'T mean: eradication of the Dark Side. Sith enslave the Force, but there are other Dark Side orders (Nightsisters and Knights of Ren in canon, more in Legends). Those orders don't enslave the Force, therefore they don't create imbalance, therefore they aren't the prime targets of Jedi (as you can see in TCW, Jedi didn't give much shit about Nightsisters for example, while canon comics confirm Sidious was afraid of them).

TL;DR:Balance in the Force means destroying all Sith, not achieving equal numbers.

Whoever made this has a real fundamental flaw in their understanding of Christianity. In Christianity its not your actions that lead you to hell, its not beleiving jesus christ is your own personal saviour who died for your sins.

So you could be a child molesting murderer, or exterminate a couple million Jews,  gays and gypsies, but as long as you believe in christ you are pretty much guaranteed a spot in heaven.

Unless you kill yourself, cos thats the most awful thing a person could ever do.....

I mean, how good do you have to be to leave behind a force ghost, really? You usually just have to not be sith, and you could make a pretty good case for Vader's sacrifice to kill the emperor and save his son a pretty solid indicator for where his heart lay as he died.

Exactly. That's why qui gon was first. He was a true believer in the force and the old way of the Jedi. He believed in Anakin as the chosen one when no one else would, and although it was a terrible process it ultimately brought balance to the universe. What's more selfless than that

2017/08/03 - 08:50:37 New comment by: Saw_Boss
That's a bit of a shit situation though. Anyone killed by surprise (say murdered by another) can't become a ghost? Even if their life was nothing but pure goodness? 

And it doesn't even make sense. The Jedi weren't at war for centuries. There will be thousands who died of old age/illness etc. Are we suggesting that none of them accepted death? Why haven't any of them come back and told of this power? You'd have thought it would be well known.

I could understand the idea that to become a ghost, you need to do some special training which QG taught Yoda, who taught Obi Wan. But then that doesn't explain why Anakin can do it.

>technically, if he had died as Vader, and not as Anakin, he wouldn't have become a force ghost. 

That's bullshit though. Vader and Anakin are the same person. Vader wasn't a separate identity surprising him, he knew who he was. He wasn't suffering a disease, he choose that life and he should accept the consequences of his actions.

All you have to do to be forgiven – according to Christian doctrine (at least protestant, I don't know about you crazy catholics) – is to repent. 

Ask and you shall be forgiven. Technically I can lead a life of sordid debauchery, and as long as I repent on my deathbed, I get to go to heaven. 

So at the level of quasi-Christian parable it checks out. 

Amazed no one has pointed this out in this thread.

Well, Finn is more realistic, but he is more pathetic too. I cant really relate to traitor-coward. In the end of the movie, of course, he changes, but that change is also too sudden and out of nowhere. And with all this american humor, for me he creates the expression of new Jar-Jar for the sequels. Not like I hate Jar-Jar, but Finn (who supposed to be one of the main characters) supposed to be much more, than comedic relief.

That's my point, people here are wanting the Force to represent moral good but it's not. It's not Jesus. It's not even nature, which is neither good nor evil. It's BOTH at the same time. It's contrasting harmonies, it's harmonious conflict, it's eternal but always changing. It deals death and life, wisdom and blindness each in turn. It craves balance yet tempts people to shake that balance.

Thats fair, but...
1. He was supposed to be brainwashed and trained from the childhood. How is he still not loyal to the First Order and still afraid of fighting? 
2. He changed for better, when he saw how Starkiller base destroyed those 5 planets. But why was he suprised? He worked on that station!!! He knew, what its gonna do. And why that Death Star 3 stopped him from escaping? Its not like First Order gonna destroy some poor planets on the outer rim.
3. I dont really get, when did he create strong bonds with Rey, they've been together literally few hours, why a coward like him would just go back to the place, that he hated the most, to save some girl? You could call it bravery, but where was that bravery before?

Nope, its the protestant loophole. Roman Catholics need works as well as grace. Im irish baptised catholic but atheist myself. I definitely remember a panel show with a Rabbi, Catholic Priest, Imam and Pastor. The Tabbi and priest said works and a good heart were all that was required for heaven and that they believed moral atheists would get into heaven. The Pastor and Imam on the other hand said that a moral atheist wo dedicated his life to helping others would not get into heaven but a deathbed conversion rapist, pederast murderer would.

I was fine with Finn initially, but when I rewatched it he became my least favorite character.

When he breaks Poe out of prison, Poe asks him why he did it. Finn initially responds with "it's the right thing to do," thinking that's the only answer that'll win Poe's trust. Poe sees through it, and correctly guesses that Finn wants to get away and needs a pilot.

From this and other lines, it seemed to me like Finn was starting to become a conscientious objector to war. He had seen the brutality of both the Resistance and the First Order (obviously more from one than the other) on Jakku, he refused to kill, and now he wanted to get away from the whole war. He's not a defector, he's more of a pacifist.

And then 20 seconds later Finn gleefully mows down soldiers and unarmed officers.

What a brave soul. Even when facing imminent death he did his duty to the Jedi Order by trolling Anakin.

Well the system is the Hosnian System, and the planet is called Hosnian Prime, but I agree what I dislike most about 7 is that they leave all the complicated backstory to all the novels. I mean, I understand why, but at the same time I didn't like it.

Where is Padme? Is she safe? Is she alright? 

2017/08/03 - 13:28:23 New comment by: Baby-exDannyBoy
You still believe in the lies of the jedi, they who talk so much about freedom but call their discipline a religion to cut taxes and set up barely disguised military training grounds for children unquestioned, use mindtrickery on innocent bystanders, enslave sentient robots and defend monarchies.

only when he's talking to Padme

Does his ghost have a robot arm or did that grow back somehow?

Guess, all that shit in the Force Unleashed games isn't considered canon then, right? Cause otherwise, Vader had been plotting to kill Uncle Frank way before Luke came into the picture.

Of all the changes, this is the one that annoys me the most. I can stomach Jedi Rocks, but I'll never accept this.

Wait how was there any doubt about it being a singular?

Well, the Hayden Christensen force ghost was added to the OT after the prequels came out

The greater question. If it's from ROTJ, but it's Hayden edited in post ROTS. Is it a prequel??????

George Lucas didn't have anybody to call him out on his stupid ideas. I hope they undo this change some day.

Honestly, I still maintain that there is nothing inherently Dark Side with a Jedi decapitating a Sith.

I always thought there was no heaven/hell in star wars universe. I interpret it as every living thing being part of the force and rejoining when they die

That's the Episode II version, the episode III version has a different title.
